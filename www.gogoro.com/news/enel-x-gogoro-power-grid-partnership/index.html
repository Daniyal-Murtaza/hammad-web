          <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Enel X and Gogoro announce new collaboration to provide critical support to Taiwan&rsquo;s electricity grid</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Taipei, October 26th, 2021</strong> &ndash; Enel X, the world&rsquo;s leading virtual power plant (VPP) and demand response service provider, and Gogoro&reg;, a global technology leader in battery swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable urban mobility, today announced they will support the integration of more renewable power on electricity grids utilizing Enel X&rsquo;s VPP platform and Gogoro Network&rsquo;s battery swapping platform, beginning in Taiwan. The project is designed to support the local electricity grid run by Taiwan Power Company (TPC), Taiwan&rsquo;s public power utility. The announcement was made during a TPC hosted press conference in Taipei, Taiwan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a global leader in sustainable urban transportation and battery swapping refueling, Gogoro is committed to working with public utilities like TPC in Taiwan, and industry leaders like Enel X, to utilize the full potential of innovative technologies like time-shifted power to support the transition to renewable power, first in Taiwan and in additional markets in the future,&rdquo; <strong>said Horace Luke, founder and CEO, Gogoro.</strong> &ldquo;By joining Enel X&rsquo;s digitalized VPP platform, we blend our ecosystems of innovative technologies together to support public utilities incorporating new renewable energy sources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enel X enables businesses to unlock significant value while supporting the renewable energy transition. It does this by aggregating distributed energy resources to create a &lsquo;virtual power plant&rsquo; that provides dispatchable capacity to help support the electricity grid. Thanks to availability of sustainable mobility and demand response programs, there is a further possibility to integrate renewable power on electricity grids. These new resources will be increasingly important as Taiwan works to meet its net-zero clean energy targets, which will require the integration of large amounts of variable renewable power generation into Taiwan&rsquo;s electricity system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to add Gogoro to our VPP network as we work to support the decarbonization and electrification of Taiwan&rsquo;s energy sector. Through our collaboration, Gogoro will be the first electric mobility provider in Taiwan to participate in a VPP, and they will participate alongside other progressive businesses across Taiwan that recognize this opportunity to earn a significant new revenue stream while furthering their sustainability objectives,&rdquo; <strong>said Jeff Renaud, Head of Enel X Asia and Oceania</strong>. &ldquo;We see huge potential in connecting Gogoro&rsquo;s unique distributed network of battery swapping stations with our VPP platform, both here in Taiwan and potentially overseas. In doing so, we can together create new resources that support the renewable energy transition, while also accelerating the electrification of transport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When called on by TPC, Enel X&rsquo;s VPP automatically adjusts its networks&rsquo; power use &ndash; including Gogoro&rsquo;s GoStations &ndash; to help protect the grid and maintain stable electricity supply.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Gogoro Network</strong></p>
<p>The Gogoro Network is an open platform for battery swapping and smart mobility services, delivering a fresh alternative to legacy fuel. Gogoro Network creates a new generation of swappable battery refueling that is smart, scalable, and continually optimizing itself to be dynamic and versatile for people, communities, and businesses. Currently in Taiwan, Gogoro has more than 2,100 GoStation battery swapping stations with nearly 1.3 GWh of power. The Powered by Gogoro Network Program gives Gogoro&rsquo;s vehicle maker partners access to Gogoro innovations including its intelligent drivetrains and controllers, components, and smart systems, so they can develop and roll out unique electric vehicles that integrate with Gogoro Network battery swapping.&nbsp;</p>
