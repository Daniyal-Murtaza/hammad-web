<p><strong>Cambridge, MA, October 4, 2023</strong> – Gogoro Inc. (Nasdaq: GGR), a global technology leader in battery swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities, today was recognized by MIT Technology Review as one of fifteen climate tech companies to watch. The announcement was made at the MIT Technology Review ClimateTech Conference held at the MIT Media Lab on MIT’s campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>MIT Technology Review’s new ‘15 Climate Tech Companies to Watch’ list highlights businesses around the world that its editors believe could have the greatest potential to substantially reduce greenhouse-gas emissions or address the threats of global warming. To access the ‘15 Climate Tech Companies to Watch’ list, visit <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/">technologyreview.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MIT Technology Review highlighted Gogoro saying, “Gogoro could make an immediate impact both by speeding up the move to electrified vehicles and by reducing the load on the grid to charge those vehicles through smart management of its power stations.”</p>
<p>“Gogoro leverages innovation to address the urban transportation and energy challenges of the world’s most densely populated cities. Today, with nearly 13,000 battery swapping stations and 400,000 daily battery swaps we’ve demonstrated that battery swapping provides a clear path to transforming urban two-wheel transportation to smart electric power,” <strong>said Horace Luke, founder, and CEO of Gogoro</strong>. “We are honored to be recognized by MIT Technology Review, a global leader in technology journalism, and applaud it for creating this list and recognizing the urgency we all face to disrupt and transform our world for the better.”</p>
<p>Founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1899, MIT Technology Review is a world-renowned, independent media company whose insight, analysis, reviews, interviews and live events explain the newest technologies and their commercial, social and political impacts. MIT Technology Review derives authority from its relationship to the world's foremost technology institution and from its editors' deep technical knowledge, capacity to see technologies in their broadest context, and unequaled access to leading innovators and researchers.</p>
