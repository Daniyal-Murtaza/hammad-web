          <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Companies initially focused on introducing an eco-friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuel-powered vehicles for the last mile delivery industry.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>MANILA, Philippines, NOVEMBER 30, 2022</strong> – Gogoro Inc. (Nasdaq: GGR), a global technology leader in battery swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities, today announced a strategic partnership in the Philippines with Globe’s 917Ventures and Ayala Corporation. The companies are initially focused on introducing an eco-friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuel-powered vehicles for the last mile delivery industry.</p>
<p>“Gogoro is honored to have the support of the Philippine’s Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to kick start this new smart mobility movement in Manila that utilizes Gogoro’s intelligent battery swapping, a new generation of EV refueling,” said Horace Luke, founder, and CEO of Gogoro. “Through our collaboration with Globe, 917Ventures and Ayala Corporation, we plan to unlock incredible environmental and sustainability benefits and introduce new smart mobility efficiencies for businesses by improving how they manage their fleets and deliveries.”</p>
<p>The companies will be launching a two-wheel battery swapping pilot in Manila using Gogoro’s industry leading battery swapping and Smartscooters. The Smartscooters are powered by Gogoro’s Swap &amp; Go battery swapping platform that uses distributed battery-swapping stations to enable convenient swapping of used batteries for new ones that deliver riders full-power in just seconds. The Smartscooters will serve as an eco-friendly alternative to fossil fuel-powered vehicles currently used by the logistics industry. This is expected to launch in Q1 2023.</p>
<p>“We are committed to helping solve the climate crisis by introducing Gogoro to logistics businesses, helping them in their sustainability efforts. In addition, the Swap &amp; Go technology will enable riders to be fully charged in just seconds and therefore eliminate the need for parking spots. Hopefully, this technology will encourage more Filipinos to switch to EV,” said Vince Yamat, Managing Director of 917Ventures.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Philippines Department of Energy’s, Energy Utilization Management Bureau</strong></p>
<p>“More than 25% of Taiwan’s quick commerce deliveries and almost all of their electric deliveries are powered by Gogoro’s battery-swapping technology, and we see this solution being most beneficial to a densely populated region like Metro Manila, which is also the hub of business districts,” said Patrick Aquino, Director of the Department of Energy’s Energy Utilization Management Bureau in the Philippines. “The success of this pilot will pave the way for a new sustainable business model in other cities in the country as well. The Philippines can learn from Taiwan’s experience.”</p>
<p><strong>The Philippines Department of Trade and Industry</strong></p>
<p>“Our country needs innovative tech-led projects that support climate action. I commend 917Ventures, Globe and the Ayala Corporation for always being at the forefront of change-making initiatives that aim to improve the lives of Filipinos while helping protect the environment,” said Rafaelita Aldaba, Undersecretary of the Philippines Department of Trade and Industry.</p>
<p><strong>Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs</strong></p>
<p>“Gogoro’s leadership in battery swapping, vehicle design, and innovation has transformed two-wheel mobility in Taiwan and fostered a new smart mobility industry of eco-friendly businesses and end-users,” said Chuan-Neng Lin, vice minister of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Taiwan. “We look forward to businesses and riders in the Philippines experiencing the benefits of Gogoro’s smart mobility like we have in Taiwan. Together, with Gogoro, we can all reach our net-zero carbon emissions goals.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Empowering the Transition of Businesses to Smart Mobility</strong></p>
<p>The Gogoro ecosystem offers businesses a path forward that is safe, sustainable, proven and easily scalable. Last mile delivery fleets require a sustainable solution that not only achieves the best alternative to gas-powered vehicles but is well suited to the specific segment needs of the delivery industry. The Gogoro platform delivers a sophisticated two-wheel battery swapping system that enables delivery operators to manage their fleets and deliveries more efficiently and sustainably.</p>
<p><strong>Gogoro Network</strong></p>
<p>At the heart of Gogoro’s ecosystem is the Gogoro Network, an open and interoperable battery swapping platform that was recognized in 2021 by Guidehouse Insights as the leading battery swapping platform for lightweight urban vehicles in the world. Gogoro Network is a new generation of swappable battery refueling that is smart, safe and continually optimizing itself to be dynamic and versatile for riders, business, and communities. With more than 520,000 riders and nearly 11,000 battery swapping GoStations at over 2,260 locations, Gogoro Network hosts more than 370,000 daily battery swaps with more than 360 million total battery swaps to date.</p>
<p><strong>About Gogoro</strong></p>
