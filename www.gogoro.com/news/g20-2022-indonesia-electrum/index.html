          <p>This week the 2022 G20 summit is happening in Bali, Indonesia. The 17th gathering of the Group of Twenty leaders, the meeting is happening today and tomorrow, Nov 15th &amp; 16th. The Summit will be the pinnacle of the G20 process and intense work carried out within the Ministerial Meetings, Working Groups, and Engagement Groups throughout the year.</p>
<p>Through our <a href="../gojek-pertamina-gogoro-partnership-indonesia-battery-swapping-jakarta/index.html">partnership and pilot in Indonesia with Electrum</a>, Gojek's joint venture with energy group TBS Energi Utama, we have deployed thirty Gogoro Smartscooters and a Gogoro GoStation battery swapping station to Bali to support the G20 summit. These vehicles are being used to transport G20 VIPs in Bali and to support the Indonesian government's broader efforts to transition to zero-emissions transportation.</p>

<p>Micah Toll of Electrek highlights the G20s electric vehicle focus earlier today in this <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/11/15/electric-motorcycles-zero-g20-summit-bali-indonesia/">story</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The main goals of the G20 Summit are to address issues with the global economy, including financial stability, climate change, and overall sustainability.</p>
<p>This year the G20 Summit is being held in Bali, Indonesia, where President Joko Widodo called for 100% of the government’s transportation used during the event to be electric vehicles.</p>
<p>In addition to electric cars, several high-profile electric two-wheeler companies have been called on to supply electric motorcycles and mopeds for use at the Summit. Companies including Zero Motorcycles, Energica, Gogoro and NIU have all provided fleets for official use."</p>
