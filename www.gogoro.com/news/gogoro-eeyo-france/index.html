          <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Gogoro Also Announced Eeyo 1, Its Second Eeyo Ebike Will Be Coming Later This Year To France, Belgium, Monaco, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Czech Republic.</em></p>
<p><strong>PARIS &ndash; October 14, 2020</strong> &ndash; <a href="../../index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gogoro</a>&reg;, a technology leader renowned for its mobile energy platform and ecosystem that is accelerating the shift to sustainable urban mobility, today announced the availability of the 11.9kg Eeyo 1s ebike in France. It also announced its second Eeyo, the Eeyo 1, would be available in the coming months in France, Belgium, Monaco, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Half the weight of typical ebikes, Eeyo 1 is built with Kevlar&reg; reinforced carbon fiber in a distinct open-frame design for lightweight, electric-assisted city riding. At the core of its nimble and responsive design is the new Eeyo Smartwheel, an all-in-one digital drive that fully integrates the motor, battery, torque sensor, and smart connectivity into a compact rear hub.</p>
<p>"With an iconic ultralight design and the innovative new Eeyo Smartwheel, the Eeyo 1 sets a new standard for ebikes that traditionally are heavy cruisers,&rdquo; said Horace Luke, founder and CEO of Gogoro Inc. &ldquo;Eeyo 1 is an innovative approach to the hyper-local and multi-modal transportation challenges people in cities face every day and we designed it so riders can navigate the busy stop and go traffic in the quickest and most agile way possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Eeyo 1 will be available in Europe in two models, the Eeyo 1s and Eeyo 1. Available today in France, the Eeyo 1s (&euro;4699 including VAT) comes in a warm white matte finish and features a full carbon fiber frame, fork, seat post, handlebars, and rims, weighing in at a mere 11.9kg. Coming later this year across most of Europe, The Eeyo 1 (&euro;4599 including VAT) will come in two distinct colors, cloud blue or lobster orange, and will feature the same carbon fiber frame and fork as the 1s, but with an alloy seat post, handlebars, and rims, and weighs 12.4kg - still half the weight of typical ebikes.</p>
<p>"We are delighted to have Gogoro in our portfolio because we share the same philosophy: to offer clean alternatives to the car,&rdquo; said Gregory Coillot, founder of Volt, the French leader in the distribution of urban mobility products. &ldquo;The electric bicycle market is currently booming and the Eeyo 1 models perfectly meet the agility and lightness needs of urban users.&rdquo; The Eeyo 1&rsquo;s forward-leaning sport geometry is extremely nimble for navigating city streets, bike lanes, and bridges. The open-frame design is strong, lightweight and smooth, and is easily carried on a rider&rsquo;s shoulder into an apartment, subway station, or on and off public transportation.</p>
<div><strong>Features</strong></div>
<p>Easy to ride and simple to own, every component has been chosen for durability and to be nearly maintenance-free. Both models of the Class 1 Eeyo ebike feature intelligent power-assist that detects pedal-power and provides increased control, power and speed, two assist modes &ndash; Sport and Eco &ndash; delivering 65&ndash;90km* riding range on a single charge, and a grease-free Gates Carbon Belt Drive in place of a traditional chain for long-lasting, worry-free durability. Eeyo 1 ships with a charger that easily snaps around the Smartwheel hub to charge the bike after riding. For a full feature list and specifications, please visit the Eeyo 1 product <a href="https://gogoro-eeyo.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">page</a>.</p>
<div><strong>Eeyo App</strong></div>
<p>Wirelessly integrated with the Eeyo Smartwheel, the Eeyo app optimizes the ride with a simple and intuitive interface. The Eeyo app also utilizes over-the-air software and firmware updates to deliver the latest features and refinements to Eeyo Smartwheel.</p>
<div><strong>Availability</strong></div>
<p>The Eeyo 1s and Eeyo 1 are both available for purchase today in France at Fnac and Darty shops (350 shops across France and online), Les Cyclistes Branch&eacute;s in Paris and specialist stores in the 10 largest French cities.</p>
