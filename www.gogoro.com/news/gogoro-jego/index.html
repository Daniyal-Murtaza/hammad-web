          <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Gogoro’s broadly deployed battery swapping ecosystem together with JEGO’s new design, vehicle innovation and aggressive introductory price creates&nbsp;a new market segment in Taiwan.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>TAIPEI, TAIWAN, March 13, 2023</strong> – Gogoro Inc. (Nasdaq: GGR), a global technology leader in battery-swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities, today announced that its new JEGO Smartscooter has achieved strong sales in its first week on the market. Reaching nearly eight-times Gogoro’s weekly L1 vehicle category sales for 2024 and more than triple Gogoro’s weekly L1 year-over-year sales compared to February 2023. Gogoro plans to begin deliveries of JEGO by the end of March.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“We’ve launched the new Gogoro JEGO Smartscooter in Taiwan and experienced strong sales in its first week on the market with more than three-times our weekly sales from February 2023 and nearly eight-times our weekly sales this year. This initial momentum demonstrates the affinity this new market segment has for JEGO and its new design, innovation and value,” <strong>said Horace Luke, founder and CEO of Gogoro.</strong> “Gogoro’s L1 category of Smartscooters traditionally account for less than 20% of our sales, but with the initial success of JEGO, we are seeing interest from a new broader market. This broader segment is looking for a more convenient and easy to use commuting solution that is also clean and sustainable. This has the potential to shift the balance of Gogoro’s L1 and L3 vehicle sales. Gogoro’s goal is to accelerate and expand the transition to electric two-wheel transportation in Taiwan and around the world, and the JEGO’s solid market entrance is a testament to that ambition.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“With more than 12,000 battery swapping stations and 1.3 million Gogoro smart batteries deployed across Taiwan we are now starting to see the mass market adoption generated through the convenience offered by swap and go battery swapping,” <strong>said Henry Chiang, general manager of Gogoro Taiwan.</strong> “It is the combination of the usability of our Gogoro Network and the functional design of the new JEGO Smartscooter that made this early sales momentum possible.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The new JEGO Smartscooter has a new body design and is equipped with many of Gogoro’s core vehicle innovations. Yet, it is available at a new aggressive starting price of USD$760 after government subsidies. Gogoro also introduced a new promotional battery swapping subscription plan that starts at USD$7 per month for 1,000km of range when prepaid for 36 months, its lowest priced subscription plan ever.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>ABOUT GOGORO</strong></p>
<p>Founded in 2011 to rethink urban energy and inspire the world to move through cities in smarter and more sustainable ways, Gogoro leverages the power of innovation to change the way urban energy is distributed and consumed. Recognized and awarded by Frost &amp; Sullivan as the “2023 Global Company of the Year for battery swapping for electric two-wheel vehicles” and MIT Technology Review as one of “15 Climate Tech Companies to Watch” in 2023, Gogoro’s battery swapping and vehicle platforms offer a smart, proven, and sustainable long-term ecosystem for delivering a new approach to urban mobility. Gogoro has quickly become an innovation leader in vehicle design and electric propulsion, smart battery design, battery swapping, and advanced cloud services that utilize artificial intelligence to manage battery charging and availability. The challenge is massive, but the opportunity to disrupt the status quo, establish new standards, and achieve new levels of sustainable transportation growth in densely populated cities is even greater.
