<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (&ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;), and Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (&ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;) that are based on beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to Poema Global Holdings Corp. (&ldquo;Poema Global&rdquo;) and Gogoro Inc. (&ldquo;Gogoro&rdquo;). In some cases, you can identify forward looking statements by the following words: &ldquo;may,&rdquo; &ldquo;will,&rdquo; &ldquo;could,&rdquo; &ldquo;would,&rdquo; &ldquo;should,&rdquo; &ldquo;expect,&rdquo; &ldquo;intend,&rdquo; &ldquo;plan,&rdquo; &ldquo;anticipate,&rdquo; &ldquo;believe,&rdquo; &ldquo;estimate,&rdquo; &ldquo;predict,&rdquo; &ldquo;project,&rdquo; &ldquo;potential,&rdquo; &ldquo;continue,&rdquo; &ldquo;ongoing,&rdquo; &ldquo;target,&rdquo; &ldquo;seek&rdquo; or the negative or plural of these words, or other similar expressions that are predictions or indicate future events or prospects, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including financial projections and expectations related to the timing of the proposed transaction between Gogoro and Poema Global are also forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although each of Poema Global and Gogoro believes that it has a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this communication, each of Poema Global and Gogoro caution you that these statements are based on a combination of facts and factors currently known and projections of the future, which are inherently uncertain. In addition, there are risks and uncertainties described in the proxy statement/prospectus on Form F-4 relating to the proposed transaction, initially filed by Gogoro with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) on November 18, 2021, as amended, and other documents filed, or to be filed, by Gogoro or Poema Global from time to time with the SEC. These filings may identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Neither Poema Global nor Gogoro can assure you that the forward-looking statements in this communication will prove to be accurate. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, among others, the ability to complete the business combination due to the failure to obtain approval from Poema Global&rsquo;s shareholders or satisfy other closing conditions in the merger agreement, the occurrence of any event that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement, the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, the amount of redemption requests made by Poema Global&rsquo;s public shareholders, costs related to the transaction, the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the risk that the transaction disrupts current plans and operations as a result of the announcement and consummation of the transaction, the outcome of any potential litigation, government or regulatory proceedings and other risks and uncertainties, including those included under the heading &ldquo;Risk Factors&rdquo; in the registration statement on Form F-4, as amended, and those included under the heading &ldquo;Risk Factors&rdquo; in the annual report on Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2020 of Poema Global and in its subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. There may be additional risks that neither Poema Global nor Gogoro presently know or that Poema Global and Gogoro currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward looking statements. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by Poema Global, Gogoro, their respective directors, officers or employees or any other person that Poema Global and Gogoro will achieve their objectives and plans in any specified time frame, or at all. The forward-looking statements in this communication represent the views of Poema Global and Gogoro as of the date of this communication. Subsequent events and developments may cause those views to change. However, while Poema Global and Gogoro may update these forward-looking statements in the future, there is no current intention to do so, except to the extent required by applicable law. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing the views of Poema Global or Gogoro as of any date subsequent to the date of this communication.</p>
