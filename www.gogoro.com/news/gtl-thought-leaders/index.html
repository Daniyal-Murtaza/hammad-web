          <p>Urban smart mobility frontrunner Gogoro is leading the transition to sustainable two-wheeled transportation in cities with smarter vehicles and its intelligent battery swapping platform.</p>
<div class="article-video-wrapper"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i5ddtHj_N2E" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p></div>
<p>With over 65% of the world’s population predicted to live in cities by 2050, sustainable transportation has become a critical priority for cities and their residents. Today, over 500 million two-wheel vehicles are on the road in Asia alone, compounding congestion, pollution, and greenhouse emissions in some of the world’s densest urban centers.</p>
<p>Gogoro was founded in 2011 to address the transportation challenges these cities are facing, with a breakthrough approach to smarter vehicles and electric refueling. Their self-developed technology and unique “Swap &amp; Go” battery swapping service lets two-wheel riders swap out depleted batteries for charged ones in seconds at locations across the city. Their “batteries not included” approach reduces vehicle cost and virtually eliminates concerns of riding range and charging time that have held back mass market adoption of electric vehicles till now. Having proven their solution in their pilot market of Taiwan, Gogoro is now focused on bringing it to the world’s top two-wheel markets of China, India, Indonesia, and across Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>“It sounded like a crazy idea when we first started, a vehicle that didn't need refueling or didn't need recharging. So, we started with that simple idea of swap…and from there we grew.”</p>
<p>- Horace Luke, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Gogoro</p>
<p>Gogoro launched in 2015, quickly differentiating itself with its award-winning Smartscooter and Gogoro Network, its innovative battery swapping platform featuring battery swapping stations distributed across urban areas. Their cloud connected, modular systems can refuel hundreds of vehicles a day in the space it takes to park a single car and is optimized to quickly scale in tightly packed cities where time and space are in short supply.</p>
<p><strong>Leading Battery Swapping Solutions</strong></p>
<p>"Gogoro battery swapping is transforming urban mobility in the world's most densely populated cities by changing how people use and share portable energy."</p>
<p>- Horace Luke, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Gogoro</p>
<p>The Gogoro Network delivers an electric refueling system to urban riders that is distributed across a city and offers easy and efficient battery swapping 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Today, in Taiwan, Gogoro Network supports over 500,000 riders that swap more than 340,000 batteries per day. In 2021 Guidehouse Insights recognized Gogoro Network as the world’s leading battery swapping solution for lightweight urban vehicles.</p>
<p>“Today you know we have half a million riders using the system, swapping hundreds of thousands of times a day, and that system really is the one we imagined from day one.”</p>
<p>- Horace Luke, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Gogoro</p>
<p><strong>The Future of Electric Vehicles</strong></p>
<p>The global electric vehicles market is estimated to reach $1.32 trillion by 2028 on a compound annual growth rate of 24.3%. As the market shifts toward electric, two-wheel electric vehicles are poised to become one of fastest growing segments in the years ahead.</p>
<p>In addition to Gogoro’s own branded Smartscooters, they’re already partnering with nine other leading vehicle makers like Yamaha, Yadea, Hero MotoCorp and others across the world, enabling them to make their own two-wheel vehicles that utilize Gogoro battery swapping.</p>
<p>Gogoro has also partnered with global electronics giant Foxconn, best known as the manufacturer of Apple’s iPhone. Gogoro will leverage Foxconn’s formidable global supply chains and immense manufacturing capabilities to accelerate the expansion of its battery swapping system and Smartscooters globally, in line with their mission to provide worldwide access to sustainable and efficient transportation solutions to secure a greener future.</p>

By 2050, nearly 7 in 10 people will live in cities. With the acceleration of urbanization, the world is expected to have 43 megacities (defined as cities with more than 10 million residents) by 2030. </p>
