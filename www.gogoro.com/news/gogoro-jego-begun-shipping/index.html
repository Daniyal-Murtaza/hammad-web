          <p style="text-align: center;">Gogoro says JEGO’s initial sales show strongest demand for a Smartscooter since the pandemic began with the majority of pre order customers being first time EV buyers.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Gogoro expects to realize the fully-paid JEGO preorder revenue in Q2 2024.</p>
<p><strong>TAIPEI, TAIWAN, April 24, 2024</strong> – Gogoro Inc. (Nasdaq: GGR), a global technology leader in battery-swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities, has begun deliveries of its new JEGO Smartscooter in Taiwan. Exceeding 6,500 fully-paid preorders, JEGO sales are showing the strongest demand for a Gogoro vehicle since the beginning of the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“JEGO has touched a positive chord with a new market segment of Taiwan riders - nearly all of our 6,500 pre order customers are first time EV riders. They are looking for a smart, convenient and sustainable vehicle and are not just embracing JEGO’s innovation and design but also access to Gogoro’s vast battery swapping network,” <strong>said Horace Luke, founder and CEO of Gogoro.</strong> “Initial JEGO sales are surpassing our expectations and showing the strongest demand we’ve seen since the beginning of the pandemic. With deliveries beginning this week, we expect to realize JEGO’s pre order revenue this quarter.”</p>
<p>The 6,500 fully paid JEGO pre-orders received are not reflected in the Taiwan government’s Q1 vehicle registration data. As JEGO deliveries have just begun, the vast majority of sales will not be included in April vehicle registration data which will be published in early May. These pre-orders will be included in Taiwan registration data when the vehicles are registered and Gogoro will account for the vehicle revenue upon customer delivery.</p>
<p>The new JEGO Smartscooter has a new body design and is equipped with many of Gogoro’s core vehicle innovations. Yet, it is available at an aggressive starting price of USD$760 after government subsidies. Gogoro also introduced a new promotional battery swapping subscription plan that starts at USD$7 per month for 1,000km of range when prepaid for 36 months, its lowest priced subscription plan ever.</p>
