          <p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Gogoro Network of E2W battery-swapping locations makes recharging convenient and quick, boosting the rider experience via low-carbon transportation for a greener and more sustainable environment.</em></p>
<p><strong>SAN ANTONIO, TX. – February 15, 2023</strong> – Based on its assessment of the global mobility sharing solutions and battery swappable for electric smartscooter industries, Frost &amp; Sullivan recognizes Gogoro with the 2023 Global Company of the Year Award for battery swapping for electric two-wheel vehicles and Gogoro’s GoShare with the 2023 Asia-Pacific Entrepreneurial Company of the Year Award. The company developed Gogoro Network, an innovative battery swapping platform for urban electric two-wheel (E2W) scooters, mopeds, and motorbikes. Beyond creating its own line of electric scooters, Gogoro provides vehicle inventions to other companies that build similar modes of transportation. Powered by AI-based advanced cloud services, the company can monitor and regulate battery availability, safety, and security to make intelligent, portable electric power accessible to all urban riders.</p>
<p>Gogoro delivers an innovative, seamless solution to urban populations that need affordable transportation with minimal maintenance and a leading-edge sustainability impact. It leverages its expertise, technology, partnerships, and first-mover advantage to meet customers’ needs for Battery-Swapping-as-a-Service to power E2Ws. Gogoro’s solutions go beyond its extensive expertise and best-in-class capabilities, with customer value as a strategic imperative. The transportation solution is easy-to-use, ecofriendly, and reliable. The Gogoro Network supports more than 527,000 riders and has more than 1.1 million smart batteries in circulation throughout the more than 12,200 battery swapping GoStations® at more than 2,500 locations. With upwards of 350,000 daily battery swaps and more than 425 million battery swaps to date, the Gogoro Network has saved more than 581,000 tons of carbon dioxide since its inception.</p>
<p>John Sisemor, best practices research analyst, Frost &amp; Sullivan, observed: “As a leading innovator in battery swapping and smart electric vehicles, Gogoro benefits from a first-mover advantage and leads Taiwan’s two-wheel electric market with 90% market share. More than 25% of all last mile deliveries in Taiwan use Gogoro battery swapping. GoShare takes advantage of all the benefits that Gogoro but enables non-scooter owners to use Gogoro Smartscooters and all of the benefits of battery swapping. And unlike most sharing services where companies need to relocate batteries and vehicles, GoShare riders swap the batteries themselves. Because of this, GoShare stands to reap the rewards of great and growing demand.”&nbsp;<br><br>GoShare utilizes Gogoro’s technology, products, and services in close collaboration with various stakeholders and cross-industry partners to boost the green transportation solution and evolve alongside market needs and trends, giving it a competitive advantage. As a result, riders have access to GoShare scooters whenever they need them, including access to the Gogoro battery-swapping network which enables them to extend range as needed. GoShare is a disruptive leader in the Asia-Pacific mobility sharing solutions industry, continually evolving and creating barriers for both existing competitors and new market entrants. Consumers enjoy an extended usable range, power output boosts, and enhancements to overall performance. With more than 1.8 million riders, GoShare has hosted more than 26 million trips across seven cities in Taiwan since launching&nbsp;<br><br>“Gogoro GoShare combines the manufacturing expertise and battery swapping network of Gogoro with the ease of GoShare to incorporate customer-centric strategies, building strong brand equity and a sterling reputation, which elevates its leadership and status as a preferred partner in the market,” added Sisemor.&nbsp;</p>
