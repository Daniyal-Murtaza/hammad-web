          <p style="text-align: center;"><em>With more than 400,000 daily battery swaps and more than 570 million total battery swaps since it launched in 2015, Gogoro has been recognized as a global leader in two-wheel battery swapping.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>TAIPEI, TAIWAN, JUNE 3, 2024</strong> – Gogoro Inc. (Nasdaq: GGR), a global technology leader in battery-swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities, today announced an agreement for $50 million investment from Gold Sino Assets Limited (“Gold Sino”) to continue its leadership in urban battery swapping ecosystems and smart mobility innovation to accelerate the shift to sustainable urban transportation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“With the success of its revolutionary battery swapping ecosystem, Gogoro continues to lead the two-wheel transformation that is shaping cities of the future to be smart, sustainable and accessible. Gogoro is delivering on its vision,” <strong>said Dr. Samuel Yin of Gold Sino and the chairman of Ruentex Group.</strong> “As Gogoro continues growing its lead in Taiwan and in its expansion markets, it is important that it continues to have the resources and flexibility to operate efficiently and continue to deliver cutting-edge innovation, unparalleled customer experience and great value to customers.”</p>
<p><strong>TRANSACTION DETAILS</strong></p>
<p>The share and warrant purchase agreement with Gold Sino, Gogoro’s largest shareholder, pursuant to which it will issue to Gold Sino (i) 32,516,095 ordinary shares of Gogoro, par value US$0.0001 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of US$50,000,000, reflecting a per share purchase price of approximately US$1.5377 and (ii) a warrant to purchase 10,838,698 ordinary shares of Gogoro with an exercise price of US$1.6915 per share (subject to certain adjustments as set forth therein). &nbsp;The closing of the transactions is expected to occur within the next few days. The funding will be used to continue Gogoro’s growth and development in Taiwan and international expansion markets.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with Dr. Yin, Gold Sino and Ruentex Group goes back to Gogoro’s founding. Dr. Yin has been our greatest advocate and shares a strong vision for how smart mobility and clean energy can create healthier and more vibrant cities,” <strong>said Horace Luke, founder and CEO of Gogoro.</strong> “This investment is a strong testament to Gogoro’s business model and vision for growing our business globally.”</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT GOGORO</strong></p>
<p>Founded in 2011 to rethink urban energy and inspire the world to move through cities in smarter and more sustainable ways, Gogoro leverages the power of innovation to change the way urban energy is distributed and consumed. Recognized by Fast Company as “Asia-Pacific’s Most Innovative Company of 2024”; Frost &amp; Sullivan as the “2023 Global Company of the Year for battery swapping for electric two-wheel vehicles”; and, MIT Technology Review as one of “15 Climate Tech Companies to Watch” in 2023, Gogoro’s battery swapping and vehicle platforms offer a smart, proven, and sustainable long-term ecosystem for delivering a new approach to urban mobility. Gogoro has quickly become an innovation leader in vehicle design and electric propulsion, smart battery design, battery swapping, and advanced cloud services that utilize artificial intelligence to manage battery charging and availability. The challenge is massive, but the opportunity to disrupt the status quo, establish new standards, and achieve new levels of sustainable transportation growth in densely populated cities is even greater.
