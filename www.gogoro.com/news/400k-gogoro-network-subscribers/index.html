<p>Gogoro Network, a hyper-efficient battery swapping platform, has quickly become the de facto standard for powering electric two-wheel vehicles in Taiwan. Together with its vehicle partners, Gogoro-powered vehicles account for nearly 97% of all electric scooters sold in Taiwan.</p>
<p><strong>Gogoro Network</strong></p>
<p>The Gogoro Network is an open platform for battery swapping and smart mobility services, delivering a fresh alternative to legacy fuel. Gogoro Network combines the power of connectivity, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to create a new generation of swappable battery refueling that is smart, scalable and continually optimizing itself to be dynamic and versatile for people, communities and businesses.</p>
<p>The Gogoro Network was recognized by Frost &amp; Sullivan with the 2020 Company of the Year Award for the Global Swappable Battery Electric Scooter Market. With more than 400,000 riders and 2,100 battery swapping stations, Gogoro Network manages 270,000 daily battery swaps and now has reached more than 200 million consumer battery swaps.</p>
<p>The Powered by Gogoro Network Program gives Gogoro’s vehicle maker partners access to Gogoro innovations and intellectual property including its intelligent drivetrains and controllers, components and smart systems, so they can develop and roll out unique electric vehicles that integrate Gogoro Network battery swapping.</p>
