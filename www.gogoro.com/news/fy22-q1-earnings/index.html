          <p><strong>TAIPEI – MAY 12, 2022</strong> – Gogoro Inc. (Nasdaq: GGR), a global technology leader in battery swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities, today released its financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First Quarter Highlights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Record first quarter revenue of $94.5 million, up 61.0% year-over-year&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sales of hardware and other revenues of $65.1 million, up 87.1% year-over-year</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gogoro Network revenue of $29.4 million, up 23.0% year-over-year</strong></li>
<li><strong>Strong growth in number of new subscribers, bringing total subscribers to more than 467,000</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>“Our first quarter reflects the strength of our core business model across Gogoro’s vehicle and component hardware sales and Gogoro Network battery swapping subscriptions and the industry-leading scale of our ecosystem,” said Horace Luke, founder, chairman, and chief executive officer of Gogoro. “We continue to grow our subscriber base with over 467,000 subscribers in Taiwan as of March 31, 2022, up 25.2% from March 31, 2021. The successful completion of our merger on April 4, 2022 and Nasdaq listing added $344.8 million of capital to our balance sheet, which will enable us to accelerate our business and continue our aggressive growth in Taiwan and other new markets.”</p>
<p><strong>First Quarter 2022 Financial Overview</strong></p>
<p><strong>Revenue&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For the first quarter, revenue was $94.5 million, up 61.0% from $58.7 million in the same quarter last year. Sales of hardware and other revenues for the first quarter was $65.1 million, up 87.1% from $34.8 million in the same quarter last year primarily as a result of increased market share in Gogoro branded scooter sales in Taiwan. Government-reported registrations of Gogoro vehicles increased by 57.7% compared to the first quarter of 2021. Gogoro Network revenue for the first quarter was $29.4 million, up 23.0% from $23.9 million in the same quarter last year. The growth reflects a continuation of growth in the electric transportation market in Taiwan and an increase in our subscriber base in Taiwan.</p>
<p><strong>Gross Margin&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For the first quarter, gross margin was 13.7%, up from 12.7% in the same quarter last year. For the first quarter, non-IFRS gross margin was 14.2%, up from 12.7% in the same quarter last year. Gross margin and non-IFRS gross margin were driven by favorable changes in our product mix and a decrease in production cost per electric scooter as we scale our production. Non-IFRS gross margin is a non-IFRS measure, see page 4 for a description of the non-IFRS measures and page 9 for a reconciliation of the company’s non-IFRS financial measures to their most directly comparable IFRS measures.</p>
<p><strong>Net Loss&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>First quarter 2022 net loss was $21.7 million, an increased loss of $2.5 million from $19.2 million in the same quarter last year. The additional net loss was primarily driven by employee share-based compensation and expenses associated with our merger with Poema Global.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Adjusted EBITDA</strong></p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA was $13.5 million, up 124.1% from $6.0 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our market share in sales of hardware accompanied by an increase of Gogoro Network subscribers, excluding non-cash share-based compensation, and one-time nonrecurring costs associated with the merger with Poema Global. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure, see page 4 for a description of the non-IFRS measures and page 9 for a reconciliation of the company’s non-IFRS financial measures to their most directly comparable IFRS measures.</p>
<p><strong>Liquidity</strong></p>
<p>Gogoro raised $344.8 million in gross proceeds from completion of the merger with Poema Global on April 4, 2022.</p>
<p><strong>2022 Guidance</strong></p>
<p>Gogoro is introducing guidance based on current market conditions and expectations. For the full year 2022, we expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue of $460.0 million to $500.0 million which represents an anticipated increase of 25.7% to 36.6% compared to 2021. Second quarter revenue is expected to contribute around 20% of the full year revenue given the uncertainty from the latest growing COVID-19 wave in both Taiwan and China, and the foreign exchange downside risk from local versus U.S. dollar currency.</li>
<li>We estimate that we will generate 90% to 95% of 2022 full year revenue from the Taiwan market.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conference Call Information</strong></p>
<p>Gogoro's management team will hold an earnings Webcast on May 12, 2022, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company's first quarter 2022 financial and business results and outlook.</p>
<p>Investors may access the webcast, supplemental financial information and investor presentation at Gogoro’s investor relations website under the “Events” section (<a href="https://bit.ly/3l4MATq">https://investor.gogoro.com/events/event-details/q1-2022-gogoro-inc-earnings-conference-call</a>).

<p>This communication contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward looking statements generally relate to future events or Gogoro's future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward looking statements because they contain words such as "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates,&rdquo; &ldquo;going to,&rdquo; "could," "intends," "target," "projects," "contemplates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern Gogoro's expectations, strategy, priorities, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this communication include, but are not limited to, statements in the section entitled, "2022 Guidance," such as estimates regarding revenue, Gogoro&rsquo;s beliefs regarding Gogoro&rsquo;s future operating performance including its ability to grow its subscriber base, projections of market opportunity and market share, the capability of Gogoro&rsquo;s technology, Gogoro&rsquo;s business plans including its plans to grow and expand in Taiwan and internationally, the expected use of proceeds from the merger, and statements by Gogoro's founder, chairman, and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Gogoro&rsquo;s expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, including risks related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Gogoro&rsquo;s ability to effectively manage its growth, Gogoro&rsquo;s ability to launch and ramp up the production of its products and control its manufacturing costs and manage its supply chain issues, Gogoro&rsquo;s risks related to ability to expand its sales and marketing abilities, Gogoro&rsquo;s ability to expand effectively into new markets, foreign exchange fluctuations, Gogoro&rsquo;s ability to develop and maintain relationships with its partners, risks related to operating in the PRC, regulatory risks and Gogoro&rsquo;s risks related to strategic collaborations, alliances or joint ventures including Gogoro&rsquo;s ability to enter into and execute its plans related to strategic collaborations, alliances or joint ventures in order for such strategic collaborations, alliances or joint ventures to be successful and generate revenue, the risks related to the need for Gogoro to invest more capital in strategic collaborations, alliances or joint ventures, and the risk of Gogoro having to update the accounting treatment for its joint ventures. The forward looking statements contained in this communication are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in Gogoro's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;), including in Gogoro&rsquo;s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed on May 2, 2022 &nbsp;and in its subsequent filings with the SEC, copies of which are available on our website and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. The forward looking statements in this communication are based on information available to Gogoro as of the date hereof, and Gogoro disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements, except as required by law.</p>
<p>Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures&nbsp;</p>
<p>This press release and accompanying tables contain certain non-International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (collectively, &ldquo;IFRS&rdquo;) financial measures including non-IFRS gross profit, non-IFRS gross margin, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-IFRS Gross Profit and Gross Margin. Gogoro defines non-IFRS gross profit and gross margin as gross profit and gross margin excluding share-based compensation expense.</p>
<p>EBITDA. Gogoro defines EBITDA, as net loss excluding interest expense, net, provision for income tax, depreciation and amortization. These amounts do not reflect the impact of any related tax effects.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA. Gogoro defines Adjusted EBITDA, as EBITDA excluding share-based compensation expense, the loss on financial liabilities at fair value as a result of reclassification and revaluation of redeemable preferred shares, and onetime non-recurring costs associated with the merger. These amounts do not reflect the impact of any related tax effects.</p>
<p>Acquisition-related Expenses. Gogoro incurs acquisition-related and other expenses which consist of costs incurred after the issuance of a definitive term sheet for a particular transaction and include legal, banker, accounting, printer costs, valuation and other advisory fees. Management excludes these items for the purposes of calculating non-IFRS adjusted EBITDA. Gogoro generally would not have otherwise incurred such expenses in the periods presented as part of its continuing operations. The acquisition-related expenses are not recurring with respect to past transactions, can be inconsistent in amount and frequency from period to period and are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of Gogoro&rsquo;s acquisitions. While these expenses are not recurring with respect to past transactions, Gogoro generally will incur these expenses in connection with any future acquisitions.</p>
<p>These non-IFRS financial measures exclude share-based compensation expense, interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, loss on financial liabilities associated with revaluation of preferred stock and onetime non-recurring costs associated with the merger. The company uses these non-IFRS financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that these non-IFRS financial measures are useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends. In addition, these measures are the primary indicators management uses as a basis for its planning and forecasting for future periods.</p>
<p>Non-IFRS financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable IFRS financial measures. Non-IFRS financial measures are subject to limitations, and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. A description of these non-IFRS financial measures has been provided above and a reconciliation of the company&rsquo;s non-IFRS financial measures to their most directly comparable IFRS measures have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.</p>
