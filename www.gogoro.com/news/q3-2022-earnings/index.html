          <p><strong>TAIPEI – November 10, 2022</strong> – Gogoro Inc. (Nasdaq: GGR), a global technology leader in battery swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities, today released its financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Third Quarter Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue of $102.2 million, up 1.5% year-over-year and up 10.7% on a constant currency basis despite the complex macroeconomic environment</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gogoro Network revenue of $30.4 million, up 17.7% year-over-year and up 28.5% on a constant currency basis. This demonstrates an increase in our battery swapping subscriber base and the ability of our business model to generate recurring revenue&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Continued Gogoro Network subscriber growth to more than 505,000 monthly battery swapping subscribers, up 20.8% or 87,000 subscribers year-over year</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gross margin of 17.4%, up slightly from 17.3% in the third quarter last year. Non-IFRS gross margin of 20.0%, up 2.7% year-over-year</strong></li>
<li><strong>Net income of $56.4 million, up from a net loss of $13.4 million in the same quarter last year, primarily due to a $85.8 million favorable change in the fair value of financial liabilities associated with outstanding earnout, earn-in and warrants</strong></li>
<li><strong>Adjusted EBITDA of $9.2 million, down from $15.2 million in the same quarter last year primarily due to $5.0 million investment in operating activities</strong></li>
<li><strong>Successfully completed a new $345 million syndicated credit facility and paid off a $182 million old credit facility obligation following the end of the third quarter</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gogoro updates full-year revenue guidance of $370.0 million to $390.0 million, reflecting continued macroeconomic headwinds</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>“Despite challenging economic conditions around the world, we delivered solid Q3 financial results. We are still seeing a strong movement by governments, businesses, and consumers to smarter, cleaner and sustainable energy and transportation, especially in the densely populated cities of Asia. Gogoro Network battery swapping continues to generate strong interest and we are working with local partners in China, Indonesia, India and other new markets,” said Horace Luke, founder, chairman, and chief executive officer of Gogoro. “In the third quarter, we announced a new Singapore-licensed B2B pilot and launched the Gogoro Network and Smartscooters in Tel Aviv, Israel. Last week, we announced our first B2B pilot in Delhi, India with Zypp Electric, India’s leading EV-as-a-Service platform that is expected to be live in December 2022.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Despite the challenging macro-economic conditions, our Q3 results were in line with our guidance, with revenue of $102.2 million and $111.4 million on a constant currency basis in the third quarter, up 1.5% year-over-year and 10.7% on a constant currency basis. Additionally our Gogoro Network revenue was $30.4 million and $33.2 million on a constant currency basis in the third quarter, an increase of &nbsp;17.7% year-over-year and 28.5% on a constant currency basis. We are investing in our existing Taiwan business and are diversifying our revenue streams to enable new markets, channels and business segments to adopt sustainable energy and transportation,” said Bruce Aitken, chief financial officer of Gogoro. “Given the strength of our cash position, the liquidity provided by our new credit facility, and an increased focus on streamlining operational efficiency, we are well positioned to navigate through challenging market conditions while we continue executing across our multiple markets and business lines.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Third Quarter 2022 Financial Overview</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operating Revenues&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For the third quarter, revenue was $102.2 million, up 1.5% year over year and up 10.7% year over year on a constant currency basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with the average rate of the third quarter of 2021, revenue would have been up by an additional $9.2 million. Sales of hardware and other revenues for the third quarter was $71.8 million, down 4.1% year over year, and up 4.6% year over year on a constant currency basis. Gogoro Network revenue for the third quarter was $30.4 million, up 17.7% year over year, and up 28.5% year over year on a constant currency basis. Total subscribers at the end of third quarter was more than 505,000, up 20.8% &nbsp;from 418,000 subscribers in the same quarter last year. The Gogoro Network revenue increase was primarily due to the accumulating subscriber base and the high retention rate of all subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>Gross Margin</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the third quarter, gross margin was 17.4%, up slightly from 17.3% in the third quarter last year. For the third quarter, non-IFRS gross margin<sup>1</sup> was 20.0%, up from 17.3% in the same quarter last year. The non-IFRS gross margin improvement was driven by an increase in the average selling price of our vehicles, favorable changes in our product mix, and the improved cost efficiency of Gogoro's Network operations.</p>
<p><strong>Net Income (Loss)</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the third quarter, net income was $56.4 million, up $69.8 million from a net loss of $13.4 million in the same quarter last year. This was primarily due to a favorable change in the fair value of financial liabilities of $85.8 million in the third quarter compared to $1.7 million loss in the same quarter last year. This was partially offset by a $11.4 million increase in share-based compensation, a $2.1 million increase in sales and marketing expenses mainly due to increase spending in retail marketing campaigns and product launches, a $1.8 million increase in research and development expenses mainly due to increased spending on materials and samples for new Smartscooter models, and a $1.0 million increase in general and administrative expenses. Non-IFRS net loss1 was $16.3 million, up $4.6 million from $11.7 million in the same quarter last year. This was primarily due to $4.9 million investment in operating activities.</p>
<p><strong>Adjusted EBITDA</strong></p>
<p>For the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA1 was $9.2 million, down from $15.2 million in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to a $2.1 million increase in expenses for sales and marketing programs, a $1.8 million increase in research and development expenses and a $1.0 million increase in general and administrative expenses, as well as a negative foreign exchange impact.</p>
<p><strong>Liquidity</strong></p>
<p>With the addition of a new $345 million credit facility and a $249.1 million cash balance at the end of the third quarter, we are well positioned to manage our liquidity in what is currently a complex macro environment. A majority of our payment obligations are denominated in the New Taiwan Dollar (TWD) and we benefited greatly from the appreciation of $193.1 million cash denominated in USD since early April 2022. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Updated 2022 Guidance</strong></p>
<p>To reflect continued macroeconomic headwinds and the impact on the overall Taiwan vehicle market, we updated our 2022 revenue guidance to $370.0 million to $390.0 million. Nearly all of Gogoro’s 2022 full year revenue will be from the Taiwan market.</p>

The forward looking statements in this communication are based on information available to Gogoro as of the date hereof, and Gogoro disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements, except as required by law.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This press release and accompanying tables contain certain non-International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (collectively, &ldquo;IFRS&rdquo;) financial measures including foreign exchange effect on operating revenues, non-IFRS gross profit, non-IFRS gross margin, Non-IFRS Net Loss, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Foreign exchange ("FX") effect on operating revenues</strong>. We compare the dollar amount and the percent change in the operating revenues from period to another period using constant currency disclosure. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying revenues performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current period operating revenues for entities reporting in currencies other than USD are converted into USD at the average exchange rates from the equivalent periods last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Non-IFRS Gross Profit and Gross Margin</strong>. Gogoro defines non-IFRS gross profit and gross margin as gross profit and gross margin excluding share-based compensation expense and exit activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Share-based Compensation Expense</strong> consists of non-cash charges related to the fair value of restricted stock units awarded to employees. The Company believes that the exclusion of these non-cash charges provides for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. In addition, the Company believes it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact of share-based compensation expense on its operating results.</p>
<p><strong>Non-IFRS Net Loss</strong>. Gogoro defines non-IFRS net loss as net income (loss) excluding share-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of financial liabilities including revaluation of redeemable preferred shares, change in fair value of earnout, earn-in and warrants associated with the merger of Poema, listing expense and onetime non-recurring costs associated with the merger. These amounts do not reflect the impact of any related tax effects.</p>
<p><strong>EBITDA</strong>. Gogoro defines EBITDA, as net income (loss) excluding interest expense, net, provision for income tax, depreciation, and amortization. These amounts do not reflect the impact of any related tax effects.</p>
<p><strong>Adjusted EBITDA</strong>. Gogoro defines Adjusted EBITDA, as EBITDA excluding share-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of financial liabilities including revaluation of redeemable preferred shares, change in fair value of earnout, earn-in and warrants associated with the merger of Poema, listing expense and onetime non-recurring costs associated with the merger. These amounts do not reflect the impact of any related tax effects.</p>
<p><strong>Acquisition-related Expenses</strong>. Gogoro incurs acquisition-related and other expenses which consist of costs incurred after the issuance of a definitive term sheet for a particular transaction and include legal, &nbsp;banker, accounting, printer costs, valuation and other advisory fees. Management excludes these items for the purposes of calculating non-IFRS adjusted EBITDA. Gogoro generally would not have otherwise incurred such expenses in the periods presented as part of its continuing operations. The acquisition related expenses are not recurring with respect to past transactions, can be inconsistent in amount and frequency from period to period and are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of Gogoro&rsquo;s acquisitions. While these expenses are not recurring with respect to past transactions, Gogoro generally will incur these expenses in connection with any future acquisitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Listing Expense</strong>. In connection with the merger with Poema, the excess fair value of shares issued by Gogoro in exchanged for the net assets of Poema was recorded as listing expense in operating expense. The listing expense for the merger is not recurring with respect to past transactions, can be inconsistent in amount and frequency from period to period and are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the merger.</p>
<p><strong>Exit Activities</strong>. We has incurred charges in connection with the exit of certain product lines as well as other non-recurring activities. These charges are not representative of ongoing costs to the business and are not expected to recur. As a result, these charges are being excluded to provide investors with a more comparable measure of costs associated with ongoing operations.</p>
<p>These non-IFRS financial measures exclude share-based compensation expense, interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, change in fair value of financial liabilities including revaluation of redeemable preferred shares, change in fair value of earnout, earn-in and warrants associated with the merger of Poema, listing expense and onetime non-recurring costs associated with the merger. The company uses these non-IFRS financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that these non-IFRS financial measures are useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends. In addition, these measures are the primary indicators management uses as a basis for its planning and forecasting for future periods.</p>
<p>Non-IFRS financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable IFRS financial measures. Non-IFRS financial measures are subject to limitations and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. A description of these non-IFRS financial measures has been provided above and a reconciliation of the company&rsquo;s non-IFRS financial measures to their most directly comparable IFRS measures have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.</p>

We are still seeing a strong movement by governments, businesses, and consumers to smarter, cleaner and sustainable energy and transportation, especially in the densely populated cities of Asia. Gogoro Network battery swapping continues to generate strong interest and we are working with local partners in China, Indonesia, India and other new markets,” said Horace Luke, founder, chairman, and chief executive officer of Gogoro. “In the third quarter, we announced a new Singapore-licensed B2B pilot and launched the Gogoro Network and Smartscooters in Tel Aviv, Israel. Last week, we announced our first B2B pilot in Delhi, India with Zypp Electric, India’s leading EV-as-a-Service platform that is expected to be live in December 2022.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Despite the challenging macro-economic conditions, our Q3 results were in line with our guidance, with revenue of $102.2 million and $111.4 million on a constant currency basis in the third quarter, up 1.5% year-over-year and 10.7% on a constant currency basis. Additionally our Gogoro Network revenue was $30.4 million and $33.2 million on a constant currency basis in the third quarter, an increase of \u0026nbsp;17.7% year-over-year and 28.5% on a constant currency basis. We are investing in our existing Taiwan business and are diversifying our revenue streams to enable new markets, channels and business segments to adopt sustainable energy and transportation,” said Bruce Aitken, chief financial officer of Gogoro. “Given the strength of our cash position, the liquidity provided by our new credit facility, and an increased focus on streamlining operational efficiency, we are well positioned to navigate through challenging market conditions while we continue executing across our multiple markets and business lines.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThird Quarter 2022 Financial Overview\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOperating Revenues\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the third quarter, revenue was $102.2 million, up 1.5% year over year and up 10.7% year over year on a constant currency basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with the average rate of the third quarter of 2021, revenue would have been up by an additional $9.2 million. Sales of hardware and other revenues for the third quarter was $71.8 million, down 4.1% year over year, and up 4.6% year over year on a constant currency basis. Gogoro Network revenue for the third quarter was $30.4 million, up 17.7% year over year, and up 28.5% year over year on a constant currency basis. Total subscribers at the end of third quarter was more than 505,000, up 20.8% \u0026nbsp;from 418,000 subscribers in the same quarter last year. The Gogoro Network revenue increase was primarily due to the accumulating subscriber base and the high retention rate of all subscribers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGross Margin\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the third quarter, gross margin was 17.4%, up slightly from 17.3% in the third quarter last year. For the third quarter, non-IFRS gross margin\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e was 20.0%, up from 17.3% in the same quarter last year. The non-IFRS gross margin improvement was driven by an increase in the average selling price of our vehicles, favorable changes in our product mix, and the improved cost efficiency of Gogoro's Network operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNet Income (Loss)\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the third quarter, net income was $56.4 million, up $69.8 million from a net loss of $13.4 million in the same quarter last year. This was primarily due to a favorable change in the fair value of financial liabilities of $85.8 million in the third quarter compared to $1.7 million loss in the same quarter last year. This was partially offset by a $11.4 million increase in share-based compensation, a $2.1 million increase in sales and marketing expenses mainly due to increase spending in retail marketing campaigns and product launches, a $1.8 million increase in research and development expenses mainly due to increased spending on materials and samples for new Smartscooter models, and a $1.0 million increase in general and administrative expenses. Non-IFRS net loss1 was $16.3 million, up $4.6 million from $11.7 million in the same quarter last year. This was primarily due to $4.9 million investment in operating activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdjusted EBITDA\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA1 was $9.2 million, down from $15.2 million in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to a $2.1 million increase in expenses for sales and marketing programs, a $1.8 million increase in research and development expenses and a $1.0 million increase in general and administrative expenses, as well as a negative foreign exchange impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLiquidity\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the addition of a new $345 million credit facility and a $249.1 million cash balance at the end of the third quarter, we are well positioned to manage our liquidity in what is currently a complex macro environment. A majority of our payment obligations are denominated in the New Taiwan Dollar (TWD) and we benefited greatly from the appreciation of $193.1 million cash denominated in USD since early April 2022. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUpdated 2022 Guidance\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo reflect continued macroeconomic headwinds and the impact on the overall Taiwan vehicle market, we updated our 2022 revenue guidance to $370.0 million to $390.0 million. Nearly all of Gogoro’s 2022 full year revenue will be from the Taiwan market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConference Call Information\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGogoro's management team will hold an earnings Webcast on November 10th, 2022, at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company's third quarter 2022 financial and business results and outlook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvestors may access the webcast, supplemental financial information and investor presentation at Gogoro’s investor relations website (\u003ca href=\"https://investor.gogoro.com/\"\u003ehttps://investor.gogoro.com\u003c/a\u003e) under the “Events” section.
