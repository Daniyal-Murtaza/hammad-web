          <h2>Electric Two-Wheelers are Already Driving EV Adoption.</h2>
<p>The BloombergNEF EVO Report for 2022 indicates that the adoption of two-wheel and three-wheel EVs is progressing significantly. Moreover, the displacement of oil from these types of vehicles is approximately five times that of four-wheel passenger EVs. This progress is due to a combination of factors. First, two-wheel vehicles are generally less expensive and more efficient, making them more accessible to a wider range of consumers, particularly in developing countries where cost is a major factor in purchasing decisions. Second, two-wheel vehicles are better suited for urban transportation as they are small, nimble, and easily navigated through traffic and park in congested areas, reducing traffic congestion. Third, the infrastructure for refueling electric two-wheel vehicles is less complex and less expensive to install than for four-wheel vehicles.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://gogoro-about-uploads.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/storage/202304/bimm0bx3pekdw3y9zmsmg9uhlrjr" alt="" width="1200" height="565"></p>
<p>However, despite these advantages, the focus in many parts of the world remains on electric four-wheel vehicles, particularly in developed countries where more investment is put towards electric four-wheel vehicles. Government policy has also been mainly focused on reducing emissions from passenger cars or trucks, resulting in less incentives and support for electric two-wheel vehicles.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why are two-wheel EVs a better option in cities?</h2>
<p>The increasing adoption of electric two-wheel vehicles is a significant step towards achieving sustainable urban transportation. In many cities worldwide, local governments are encouraging the adoption of electric two-wheel vehicles as a solution to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. As cities become increasingly congested, electric two-wheel vehicles offer an efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective mode of transportation for short trips and urban commuting.</p>
<p><br>Compared to traditional gas-powered vehicles, electric two-wheel vehicles emit significantly less GHG emissions per passenger kilometer. According to studies, electric two-wheel vehicles emit up to 67% fewer GHG emissions compared to their four-wheel counterparts. This reduction in emissions will have a significant positive impact on urban air quality, bringing major benefits for public health. The adoption of electric two-wheel vehicles can also reduce noise pollution, another key issue in densely populated urban areas.</p>

<p>Furthermore, electric two-wheel vehicles offer a more efficient use of space in congested cities. They occupy up to 5.1 times less space than standard four-wheel vehicles, which is a crucial factor in cities where space is scarce. Electric two-wheel vehicles also enable easy maneuverability in congested areas and can easily navigate through traffic. As a result, they offer an ideal mode of transportation for urban commuters looking to avoid traffic congestion and reduce their commute time.</p>

<p>Lastly, electric two-wheel vehicles offer another significant advantage in having superior battery swapping technology. Innovative battery-swapping technology enables riders to quickly and easily swap their depleted batteries for a fully charged ones, eliminating the need to wait for batteries to charge. This technology offers longer, more uninterrupted rides, which is essential for urban commuters who rely on their vehicles for daily transportation.</p>

<p>Overall, the adoption of electric two-wheel vehicles is a significant step towards sustainable urban transportation. With their low emissions, efficient use of space, and innovative technology, electric two-wheel vehicles, like Gogoro Smartscooters, offer a sustainable solution to urban transportation. A pioneer in this space, Gogoro contributes to this global effort by providing a sustainable, convenient, and efficient mode of transportation well-suited for urban environments.</p>

</a>  <p class="typography-article-summary">Today, about 56% of the world’s population - 4.4 billion inhabitants - live in cities. According to the United Nations, this trend is expected to continue. By 2050, nearly 7 in 10 people will live in cities. With the acceleration of urbanization, the world is expected to have 43 megacities (defined as cities with more than 10 million residents) by 2030. </p>
