          <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Companies to launch Gogoro’s Smartscooters and battery swapping for consumers and </em><em>B2B delivery riders in Chile and Colombia in Q2 2024.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SANTIAGO, CHILE, JANUARY 31, 2024</strong> – Gogoro Inc. (Nasdaq: GGR), a global technology leader in battery-swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities, today announced it was partnering with leading Latin American energy company, Copec, to launch its battery swapping and Smartscooters in Chile and Colombia in Q2 2024.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Our partnership with Copec, a major Latin American energy company, is an important milestone in our mission to transform urban transportation around the world. Together we will provide an accessible path for both consumer and delivery riders to adopt sustainable urban mobility and play a key role in battling climate change and making the world better for all,” <strong>said Horace Luke, founder and CEO of Gogoro.</strong> “On average, last mile delivery riders ride more than six-times the distance as consumer riders, so enabling these delivery riders to adopt smart sustainable electric transportation can have an accelerated impact on cities.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"The implementation of Gogoro’s battery swapping system in Chile and Colombia is our first entry into two-wheel electric mobility, which means that sustainable mobility will reach many more segments of the population,” <strong>said Arturo Natho, CEO of Copec.</strong> “The partnership with Gogoro will allow us to extend the benefits of electrification and generate a positive impact on people through this pioneering service in the region."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With Gogoro, Copec is developing the first Latin American network of battery swapping stations that it is launching at Copec service stations in Santiago, Chile; and, with Terpel, a Copec company’s, service stations in Bogota, Colombia.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Gogoro Network cloud service utilizes advanced real-time monitoring that ensures optimal Smartscooter and battery performance and diagnostics that enable Copec and Gogoro customers to have a safe and reliable battery swapping and ride experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Gogoro Battery Swapping</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the heart of Gogoro’s ecosystem is an open and interoperable battery swapping platform that was recognized by Guidehouse Insights in 2023 as the leading battery swapping company for lightweight urban vehicles in the world. Gogoro battery swapping is a new generation of swappable battery refueling that is smart, safe, and continually optimizing itself to be dynamic and versatile for riders, businesses, and communities. In Taiwan, the Gogoro Network supports nearly 600,000 riders and has more than 1.3 million smart batteries in circulation through its network of 12,000 battery swapping stations at over 2,500 locations. With more than 450,000 daily battery swaps and more than 535 million total battery swaps to date, Gogoro battery swapping has saved more than 900,000 tons of CO2 since it launched in 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>About Copec</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Copec is an established energy and retail company based in Chile, with a presence throughout Latin America through its subsidiary, Terpel. It currently operates more than 3,000 service stations and retail stores across Latam, which include the largest electric charging network for EVs in South America, with 1,800 kilometers of extension along Chile. To address the energy transition and adopt the new trends in mobility and retail, in 2019 Copec created Copec Wind, the company’s innovation and new ventures platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>About Gogoro</strong></p>
<p>Founded in 2011 to rethink urban energy and inspire the world to move through cities in smarter and more sustainable ways, Gogoro leverages the power of innovation to change the way urban energy is distributed and consumed. Recognized and awarded by Frost &amp; Sullivan as the “2023 Global Company of the Year for battery swapping for electric two-wheel vehicles” and MIT Technology Review as one of “15 Climate Tech Companies to Watch” in 2023, Gogoro’s battery swapping and vehicle platforms offer a smart, proven, and sustainable long-term ecosystem for delivering a new approach to urban mobility. Gogoro has quickly become an innovation leader in vehicle design and electric propulsion, smart battery design, battery swapping, and advanced cloud services that utilize artificial intelligence to manage battery charging and availability. The challenge is massive, but the opportunity to disrupt the status quo, establish new standards, and achieve new levels of sustainable transportation growth in densely populated cities is even greater.
