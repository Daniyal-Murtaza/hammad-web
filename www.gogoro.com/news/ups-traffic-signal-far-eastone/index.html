          <p style="text-align: center;"><em>New Traffic Signal Backup System Utilizes Swappable Gogoro Batteries&nbsp;To Prevent Traffic Signal Power Outages</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>New System Demonstrates Success By Maintaining Traffic Flow&nbsp;During The Recent Power Outage in Taiwan&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Taipei, Taiwan, March 22, 2022</strong> &ndash; Gogoro&reg; Inc., a global technology leader in battery swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities, today announced a Smart Traffic Signal Uninterruptible Power System (UPS) that was developed in cooperation with Far EasTone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Designed to eliminate traffic signal interruptions during power outages and maintain traffic safety, the Smart Traffic Signal UPS has been in testing and already demonstrated success during Taiwan&rsquo;s recent power outages in early March 2022 by enabling traffic signals to remain operational for two hours until the power returned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gogoro is best known for our industry-leading urban battery swapping ecosystem for two-wheel vehicles, but we are really beginning to see the broad potential that portable, swappable power has in urban environments like traffic signal backup, parking meters and streetlights,&rdquo; said Horace Luke, founder, chairman, and chief executive officer of Gogoro. &ldquo;The Gogoro-powered Smart Traffic Signal UPS we developed with Far EasTone is another practical example of how portable power is enabling a new phase of urban management for cities to become smarter and more connected."</p>
<p>The Smart Traffic Signal UPS is equipped with two swappable Gogoro smart batteries that can maintain traffic signals for up to 3.5 hours, and are connected to Far EasTone's UPS monitoring platform to perform real-time monitoring and power outage alerts. If there is an outage, the maintenance team can detect it and deal with it as soon as possible and even if the outage lasts longer, the maintenance team can swap out depleted batteries for charged ones to extend the service time of the traffic signal.</p>
<p>Gogoro and Far EasTone are actively working with the Taipei City Government to commercially deploy the Smart Traffic Signal UPS and are in discussions with other city and county governments in Taiwan to introduce the solution.</p>

<p><strong>Gogoro Network&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>At the heart of Gogoro&rsquo;s ecosystem is the Gogoro Network, an open and interoperable battery swapping platform that was recognized in 2021 by Guidehouse Insights as the leading battery swapping company for lightweight urban vehicles in the world. Gogoro Network is a new generation of swappable battery refueling that is smart, scalable, and continually optimizing itself to be dynamic and versatile for people, communities, and businesses. With more than 450,000 riders and over 10,000 battery swapping GoStations at over 2,300 locations, Gogoro Network is hosting 340,000 daily battery swaps with more than 270 million total battery swaps to date. Gogoro Battery Swapping has become the de facto battery swapping standard for two-wheel vehicles in Taiwan, powering 95% of all electric two-wheelers.&nbsp;</p>
