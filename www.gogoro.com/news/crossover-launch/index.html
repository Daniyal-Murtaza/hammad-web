          <p><em>Based on a completely redesigned all-terrain frame, the CrossOver enables increased rigidity while offering a variety of riding and storage capabilities.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>TAIPEI, TAIWAN, OCTOBER 24, 2023</strong> – Gogoro Inc. (Nasdaq: GGR), a global technology leader in battery swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities, today introduced the Gogoro CrossOver Smartscooter, the first two-wheel SUV. Designed to be customized and personalized, CrossOver riders can also adapt its functions on the fly. The CrossOver will be available in Taiwan later this quarter in two models: CrossOver and CrossOver S.</p>
<p>“The Gogoro CrossOver embodies everything our brand has come to stand for. Highlighted by new functional design features, improved performance and the latest in innovation, the CrossOver is focused on being personally customizable by each rider,” <strong>said Horace Luke, founder, and CEO of Gogoro</strong>. “The CrossOver is based on a completely redesigned all-terrain frame that enables increased rigidity while offering a variety of storage and riding capabilities. The CrossOver is a significant step forward for our vehicle product family in Taiwan and across our new markets where we continue to expand vehicle options for our customers.”</p>
<p><strong>New All-Terrain Chassis</strong></p>
<p>Optimized for various road conditions, the Gogoro CrossOver adopts a newly developed all-terrain frame that provides increased rigidity for improved strength and stability. The new frame also provides 14.2 centimeters of ground clearance, the highest in Gogoro’s current vehicle lineup.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Flexible Cargo Capacity</strong></p>
<p>Designed to adapt in various riding scenarios, the CrossOver provides passenger riding space as well as ample storage options with a new mounting point expansion system that includes 26 locking points. With the ability to leverage four cargo areas including a platform design headlight, foot, seat and rear cargo space, the CrossOver can easily accommodate most storage needs. To carry more, the rear seat can be flipped up or removed to add cargo storage as needed. Additionally, Gogoro has developed a variety of new accessories that include a side faceplate rack, off-road front rack and lightweight aluminum front basket.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Powerful Performance and Easy Control&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>CrossOver continues Gogoro’s leadership in ride experience and performance. Integrated with a G2.2 aluminum alloy water-cooled permanent magnet synchronous motor that provides maximum power of 7.6 kW, CrossOver is also equipped with a FLO DRIVE™ belt drive system that provides a smooth ride experience. Gogoro CrossOver integrates a Synchronized Braking System (SBS) that is equipped with front/rear disc brakes that stabilize and shorten the braking distance. &nbsp;</p>
<p>CrossOver’s new frame design greatly increases the durability of the suspension system and accommodates larger loads while taking into account comfort and stability. CrossOver’s suspension integrates a telescopic front fork and a dual rear shock absorber. It also has 12-inch Maxxis MA-EV high-grip dual-performance tires. CrossOver utilizes a tactical LED ultra-bright full-time headlight that expands loading capacity while retaining a complete beam irradiation range.</p>
<p><strong>Smart Features</strong></p>
<p>The CrossOver series is equipped with the new 6.8 iQ System® that enables it to add various smart functions that can be instantly added through Gogoro’s Mobile App. In addition to existing Bluetooth controls, CrossOver Series can also utilize LTE smart remote networking services that allow riders to connect their CrossOver with 24 hour active message notifications, remote command and control, real-time online vehicle condition inspection including vehicle tip over warnings, vehicle locking/unlocking, compartment opening, vehicle location query and other functions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gogoro CrossOver S is equipped with the latest generation SSmartcore intelligent driving electronic control core and specifically integrates Gogoro’s new Traction Control System (TCS) and optional cruise control mode that allows riders to quickly start cruise control with one click.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Colors</strong></p>
<p>With the introduction of CrossOver in Taiwan, Gogoro is introducing the Gogoro Bespoke Club for Smartscooter customization services that let CrossOver riders create their own unique and personalized Smartscooter with more than 100 color combinations.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong></p>
<p>The CrossOver will be available in two color combinations: Desert White or Night Storm Grey. The CrossOver S will be available in four color combinations: Myst Red, Summit Yellow, Desert White or Night Storm Grey.&nbsp;</p>
