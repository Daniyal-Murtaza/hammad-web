          <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Gogoro and Shengming Technology Collaborate To Develop Smart Parking Meter That Utilizes Gogoro&rsquo;s Smart Batteries To Accelerate Smart City Infrastructure Deployments And Extends Battery Lifetime Value.</em></p>
<p><strong>Taipei, Taiwan, December 14, 2021</strong> - Gogoro&reg; Inc., a global technology leader in battery swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities, today announced it was launching a new urban battery initiative utilizing &nbsp;Gogoro-powered smart parking meters. Co-developed with Shengming Technology, the smart parking meter enables cities to embrace smart city technologies for their paid parking locations that are off the power grid and wirelessly connected. &nbsp;</p>
<p>"Gogoro designed our smart battery and swapping system to actively manage and extend the lifespan of each battery, because maximizing the usage of our natural resources has always been a top priority," said <strong>Horace Luke, founder, and CEO, Gogoro Inc.</strong> &ldquo;Portable, swappable power has so much potential in urban environments beyond vehicles. The Gogoro-powered smart parking meter enables a new phase of urban management for cities to become smarter and more connected without the need of costly and time-consuming electricity grid construction."</p>
<p>Currently being deployed in New Taipei City Taiwan, the smart parking meter will be operational in early 2022 with 6,000 additional smart parking meters rolling out across Taiwan by the end of 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cities around the world manage thousands of public parking spaces and are looking for technologies to improve billing accuracy and real-time data analysis. With the new smart parking meter, Gogoro is providing cities with smart city technologies that fast track the deployment of wireless connectivity and off-grid power for a range of uses including parking management. Co-developed by Shengming Technology and Gogoro, the smart parking meter can utilize Gogoro smart batteries that are no longer optimized for high-performance vehicles, but can still be utilized as a powerful energy source.</p>
