          <p><strong>TAIPEI – AUGUST 11, 2022</strong> – Gogoro Inc. (Nasdaq: <a href="https://bit.ly/3BUocxv">GGR</a>), a global technology leader in battery swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities, today released its financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Second Quarter Highlights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue of $90.7 million, up 5.3% year-over-year despite the impact of COVID and continued adverse market conditions in Taiwan and other growth markets. Our revenue was negatively impacted by the approximately 6.7% change in exchange rate between TWD, our booking currency, and USD, our reporting currency, since the beginning of the year</li>
<li>Gogoro Network revenue of $30.4 million, up 29.1% year-over-year, demonstrating continued growth, an accumulating subscriber base and recurring revenue generated by its battery swapping business model</li>
<li>Gross margin of 14.0%, up 1.3% year-over-year and non-IFRS gross margin of 15.5%, up 2.8% year-over-year, based on improved product portfolio mix and improved Gogoro Network cost efficiency</li>
<li>Continued growth in Gogoro Network subscriber base to more than 484,000 monthly battery swapping subscribers</li>
<li>Net loss of $121.1 million, up from $20.6 million in the same quarter last year primarily due to a one-time $178.8 million listing expense for the SPAC merger transaction as required under IFRS accounting and adjusted EBITDA of $9.3 million, up 14.4% from $8.1 million in the same quarter last year</li>
</ul>
<p>“Despite the broad second quarter impact COVID had in Taiwan and across the region, Gogoro's second quarter year-over-year revenue increased by 5.3% to $90.7 million. Our revenue would have been marginally higher had it not been for the negative impact of the currency exchange rate between the New Taiwan Dollar and the USD, that amounted to approximately 6.7% since the beginning of the year. Notably, Gogoro Network revenue saw a 29.1% year-over-year increase to $30.4 million driven by an increase in total subscribers and the recurring nature of our business model,” said Horace Luke, founder, chairman, and chief executive officer of Gogoro. “These results demonstrate the strength and potential growth of our battery swapping ecosystem in Taiwan and in our new markets, but given the current adverse market conditions, global macroeconomic challenges, and COVID uncertainty, we are taking a conservative approach to our second half business plans.”</p>
<p><strong>Second Quarter 2022 Financial Overview</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operating Revenues&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For the second quarter, operating revenues was $90.7 million, up 5.3% from $86.1 million in the same quarter last year. Gogoro Network revenue for the second quarter was $30.4 million, up 29.1% from $23.6 million in the same quarter last year. Total subscribers increased to more than 484,000 monthly battery swapping users at the end of the second quarter. This increase in battery swapping revenue was primarily due to the accumulating subscriber base and the high retention rate of all subscribers. Sales of hardware and other revenues for the second quarter was $60.3 million, down 3.6% from $62.6 million in the same quarter last year. This was due to general consumer conservatism in Taiwan which was driven by COVID and the associated drop in retail foot-traffic and vehicle sales year-over-year. However, sales of Gogoro vehicles for the first half of 2022 grew by 3.5% compared to the first half of 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gross Margin&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For the second quarter, gross margin was 14.0%, up from 12.7% in the same quarter last year and non-IFRS gross margin was 15.5%, up from 12.7%. These gross margin and non-IFRS gross margin increases were driven by an increase in the average selling price of our vehicles, favorable changes in our product mix, and the improved cost efficiency of Gogoro's Network operations. Non-IFRS gross margin is a non-IFRS measure, see Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures for a description of the non-IFRS measures and Reconciliation of IFRS Financial Metrics to Non-IFRS for a reconciliation of the company’s non-IFRS financial measures to their most directly comparable IFRS measures.</p>
<p><strong>Net Loss&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For the second quarter, net loss was $121.1 million, up $100.5 million from $20.6 million in the same quarter last year primarily due to a one-time $178.8 million listing expense for the SPAC merger transaction as required under IFRS accounting. Additional contributors included $18.5 million in merger expenses and $11.0 million in share-based compensation expense, which were partially offset by an increase in the fair market value of outstanding warrants and earn-out shares of $104.1 million. Non-IFRS net loss was $16.8 million, up $0.1 million from $16.7 million in the same quarter last year. Non-IFRS net loss is a non-IFRS measure, see Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures for a description of the non-IFRS measures and Reconciliation of IFRS Financial Metrics to Non-IFRS for a reconciliation of the company’s non-IFRS financial measures to their most directly comparable IFRS measures.</p>
<p><strong>Adjusted EBITDA</strong></p>
<p>For the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $9.3 million, up 14.4% from $8.1 million in the same quarter last year. &nbsp;The increase was primarily due to non-IFRS gross profit increasing to $14.1 million, up 28.1% from $11.0 million in the same quarter last year as a result of the continuous growth of Gogoro Network business in the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure, see Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures for a description of the non-IFRS measures and Reconciliation of IFRS Financial Metrics to Non-IFRS for a reconciliation of the company’s non-IFRS financial measures to their most directly comparable IFRS measures.</p>
<p><strong>Liquidity</strong></p>
<p>Cash balance at the end of second quarter was $378.8 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Revised 2022 Guidance</strong></p>
<p>Given the current market and macroeconomic conditions combined with the impact of COVID in Taiwan and continued COVID and adverse market conditions in China and other markets, we are adjusting our 2022 revenue guidance to $380.0 million to $410.0 million. We will focus on maintaining our gross margin in the second half of the year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Third quarter revenue is expected to contribute around 25% of the full year revenue.</li>
<li>We estimate that almost all 2022 full year revenue will be from the Taiwan market.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This press release and accompanying tables contain certain non-International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (collectively, “IFRS”) financial measures including non-IFRS gross profit, non-IFRS gross margin, Non-IFRS Net Loss, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Non-IFRS Gross Profit and Gross Margin.</strong> Gogoro defines non-IFRS gross profit and gross margin as gross profit and gross margin excluding share-based compensation expense.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Share-based Compensation Expense</strong> consists of non-cash charges related to the fair value of restricted stock units awarded to employees. The Company believes that the exclusion of these non-cash charges provides for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. In addition, the Company believes it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact of share-based compensation expense on its operating results.</p>
<p><strong>Non-IFRS Net Loss.</strong> Gogoro defines non-IFRS net loss as net loss excluding share-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of financial liabilities including revaluation of redeemable preferred shares, change in fair value of earnout and warrants associated with the merger of Poema, listing expense and onetime non-recurring costs associated with the merger. These amounts do not reflect the impact of any related tax effects.</p>
<p><strong>EBITDA.</strong> Gogoro defines EBITDA, as net loss excluding interest expense, net, provision for income tax, depreciation, and amortization. These amounts do not reflect the impact of any related tax effects.</p>
<p><strong>Adjusted EBITDA.</strong> Gogoro defines Adjusted EBITDA, as EBITDA excluding share-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of financial liabilities including revaluation of redeemable preferred shares, change in fair value of earnout and warrants associated with the merger of Poema, listing expense and onetime non-recurring costs associated with the merger. These amounts do not reflect the impact of any related tax effects.</p>
<p><strong>Acquisition-related Expenses.</strong> Gogoro incurs acquisition-related and other expenses which consist of costs incurred after the issuance of a definitive term sheet for a particular transaction and include legal, &nbsp;banker, accounting, printer costs, valuation and other advisory fees. Management excludes these items for the purposes of calculating non-IFRS adjusted EBITDA. Gogoro generally would not have otherwise incurred such expenses in the periods presented as part of its continuing operations. The acquisition related expenses are not recurring with respect to past transactions, can be inconsistent in amount and frequency from period to period and are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of Gogoro’s acquisitions. While these expenses are not recurring with respect to past transactions, Gogoro generally will incur these expenses in connection with any future acquisitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Listing Expense.</strong> In connection with the merger with Poema, the excess fair value of shares issued by Gogoro in exchanged for the net assets of Poema was recorded as listing expense in operating expense. The listing expense for the merger is not recurring with respect to past transactions, can be inconsistent in amount and frequency from period to period and are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the merger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These non-IFRS financial measures exclude share-based compensation expense, interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, change in fair value of financial liabilities including revaluation of redeemable preferred shares, change in fair value of earnout and warrants associated with the merger of Poema, listing expense and onetime non-recurring costs associated with the merger. The company uses these non-IFRS financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that these non-IFRS financial measures are useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends. In addition, these measures are the primary indicators management uses as a basis for its planning and forecasting for future periods.</p>
<p>Non-IFRS financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable IFRS financial measures. Non-IFRS financial measures are subject to limitations and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. A description of these non-IFRS financial measures has been provided above and a reconciliation of the company’s non-IFRS financial measures to their most directly comparable IFRS measures have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.</p>

Non-IFRS gross margin is a non-IFRS measure, see Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures for a description of the non-IFRS measures and Reconciliation of IFRS Financial Metrics to Non-IFRS for a reconciliation of the company’s non-IFRS financial measures to their most directly comparable IFRS measures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNet Loss\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the second quarter, net loss was $121.1 million, up $100.5 million from $20.6 million in the same quarter last year primarily due to a one-time $178.8 million listing expense for the SPAC merger transaction as required under IFRS accounting. Additional contributors included $18.5 million in merger expenses and $11.0 million in share-based compensation expense, which were partially offset by an increase in the fair market value of outstanding warrants and earn-out shares of $104.1 million. Non-IFRS net loss was $16.8 million, up $0.1 million from $16.7 million in the same quarter last year.

Gogoro’s battery swapping and vehicle platforms offer a smart, proven and sustainable long-term ecosystem for delivering a new approach to urban mobility. Gogoro has quickly become an innovation leader in vehicle design and electric propulsion, smart battery design, battery swapping, and advanced cloud services that utilize artificial intelligence to manage battery availability and safety. The challenge is massive, but the opportunity to disrupt the status quo, establish new standards, and achieve new levels of sustainable transportation growth in densely populated cities is even greater.

The Company believes that the exclusion of these non-cash charges provides for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. In addition, the Company believes it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact of share-based compensation expense on its operating results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNon-IFRS Net Loss.\u003c/strong\u003e Gogoro defines non-IFRS net loss as net loss excluding share-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of financial liabilities including revaluation of redeemable preferred shares, change in fair value of earnout and warrants associated with the merger of Poema, listing expense and onetime non-recurring costs associated with the merger. These amounts do not reflect the impact of any related tax effects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEBITDA.\u003c/strong\u003e Gogoro defines EBITDA, as net loss excluding interest expense, net, provision for income tax, depreciation, and amortization.

These amounts do not reflect the impact of any related tax effects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAcquisition-related Expenses.\u003c/strong\u003e Gogoro incurs acquisition-related and other expenses which consist of costs incurred after the issuance of a definitive term sheet for a particular transaction and include legal, \u0026nbsp;banker, accounting, printer costs, valuation and other advisory fees. Management excludes these items for the purposes of calculating non-IFRS adjusted EBITDA. Gogoro generally would not have otherwise incurred such expenses in the periods presented as part of its continuing operations. The acquisition related expenses are not recurring with respect to past transactions, can be inconsistent in amount and frequency from period to period and are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of Gogoro’s acquisitions. While these expenses are not recurring with respect to past transactions, Gogoro generally will incur these expenses in connection with any future acquisitions.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eListing Expense.\u003c/strong\u003e In connection with the merger with Poema, the excess fair value of shares issued by Gogoro in exchanged for the net assets of Poema was recorded as listing expense in operating expense. The listing expense for the merger is not recurring with respect to past transactions, can be inconsistent in amount and frequency from period to period and are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the merger.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese non-IFRS financial measures exclude share-based compensation expense, interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, change in fair value of financial liabilities including revaluation of redeemable preferred shares, change in fair value of earnout and warrants associated with the merger of Poema, listing expense and onetime non-recurring costs associated with the merger. The company uses these non-IFRS financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that these non-IFRS financial measures are useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends. In addition, these measures are the primary indicators management uses as a basis for its planning and forecasting for future periods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNon-IFRS financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable IFRS financial measures. Non-IFRS financial measures are subject to limitations and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. A description of these non-IFRS financial measures has been provided above and a reconciliation of the company’s non-IFRS financial measures to their most directly comparable IFRS measures have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGogoro Media Contact:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason Gordon, Gogoro\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e+1 (206) 778-7245\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejason.gordon@gogoro.com\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGogoro Investor Contact:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael Bowen, ICR, LLC.\u003cbr\u003egogoroIR@icrinc.com\u003cbr\u003eir@gogoro.com\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://gogoro-about-uploads.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/storage/202208/vpllifxsa10cadxezgpq5bhrh0bz\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://gogoro-about-uploads.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/storage/202208/ozbqn8f3noxfx6d37km3r5d6k1wv\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://gogoro-about-uploads.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/storage/202208/m3z8w6yali74wa0ikk6a0ov6a6on\" alt=\"\" width=\"816\" height=\"1381\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://gogoro-about-uploads.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/storage/202208/a0z3in5cigpu87cnkpc3r7hfo00h\" alt=\"\" width=\"818\" height=\"941\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","author":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Gogoro","url":"https://www.gogoro.com"},"url":"https://www.gogoro.com/news/2022-q2-earnings/"}
