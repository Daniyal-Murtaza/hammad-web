<!--more-->
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Last week, Gogoro was honored to host a distinguished guest, former vice president of the United States and Nobel Prize recipient Al Gore. As part of a special all-company meeting, Mr. Gore delivered an inspiring and captivating presentation on climate change and the critical role technology and innovation must play as the solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;"><img src="https://gogoro-about-uploads.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/9zrx16xkf6plhr26wkx85dezzxsy" alt="al_gore_visits_gogoro_4.jpg" /><em style="font-size: 10px; background-color: transparent; font-family: graphik-lt, PingFangTC-Light, 'Noto Sans Light';">Mr. Al Gore presents to the Gogoro employees at a special event in Taipei, Taiwan.</em><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Mr. Gore is not just an avid environmental activist, but the cofounder of Generation Investment Management, which we were proud to <a href="../../press/2017-09-28/go-share-announcement/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce as an investor</a> this past summer. His 60-minute talk featured bold statistics on the increasing amount of carbon and heat overtaking our air and oceans. Some of his mind-boggling stats can be seen in his new film <em>An Inconvenient Sequel</em>, which was released this past summer and screened by the entire Gogoro staff in an all-company event earlier in October. He also highlighted new data on recent storms that have hit Taiwan, the Caribbean, and southern United States, reiterating the criticality of this point in time. </span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;"><img src="https://gogoro-about-uploads.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/w30ohd3n2nf551mys4deyeit9mw9" alt="al_gore_visits_gogoro_2.jpg" /></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;">One thing that stuck with many employees was his powerful concept of the "sustainability revolution,&rdquo; which has been widely propelled by Mr. Gore in recent months, including in his recent keynote at the United Nations COP23 climate summit in Bonn, Germany as well as the final keynote at the WebSummit 2017 in Lisbon, Portugal, where our CEO Horace Luke was also a speaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;"><img src="https://gogoro-about-uploads.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/c8xkdqth1e79m4yemhczii72tohn" alt="al_gore_visits_gogoro_3.jpg" /><em style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 10px; font-family: graphik-lt, PingFangTC-Light, 'Noto Sans Light';">Gogoro employees were simultaneously entertained and inspired by Mr. Gore&rsquo;s engaging presentation.</em><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Mr. Gore highlighted his belief that entrepreneurs are the secret to saving the planet and even featured the Gogoro Smartscooter and GoStation, and Smart Battery in his presentation. &ldquo;I show this slide every time, &ldquo; he said, "Exciting new businesses like Gogoro can have much more influence than practically anybody else."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;">It was hard not to be touched by his passionate call-to-action to humanize climate change, echoing our vision of putting power in the hands of people to create positive change. He repeatedly encouraged us that if we held focus on this vision, we could be a driving force together, &ldquo;You are not alone.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;"><img src="https://gogoro-about-uploads.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/j1b2s579z5fv5renem5jac4z8ck6" alt="al_gore_visits_gogoro_1.jpg" /><em style="background-color: transparent; font-family: graphik-lt, PingFangTC-Light, 'Noto Sans Light';"><span style="font-size: 10px;">Mr. Al Gore and Gogoro CEO Horace Luke walk through the Gogoro vision and roadmap at a company show-and-tell event in Taipei, Taiwan.</span></em><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent;">We came away encouraged, energized, and fully aware that Gogoro can and will be part of the solution to ultimately curb climate change. <br /><br />&ldquo;Mr. Gore's visit will be remembered forever by employees, many who have said it was one of the most inspirational days of their lives,&rdquo; said Horace Luke, founder and CEO of Gogoro. &ldquo;We are honored to have Mr. Gore and Generation Investment Management as our partner as we share in the same business philosophy of sustainability and technology innovation as a solution to create positive change.</span></p>
