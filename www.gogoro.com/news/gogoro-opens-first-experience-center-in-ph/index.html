          <p>Here comes the future, and it’s riding an electric wave!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gogoro Philippines, a pioneering force in e-mobility, opened its first experience center in Makati City on November 7 as it gears up for its commercial launch in the country. Located at 2/F, Greenbelt 4, Ayala Center, this innovative hub offers an immersive experience, giving visitors a taste of what it is like to use Gogoro Smartscooters® and battery-swapping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"With the opening of our first<strong> Gogoro Experience Center</strong> (GEC), we are not just unveiling a store, we are opening the doors to the next chapter of mobility in the Philippines. Filipinos are invited to step in, explore, and be a part of this transformative journey towards a smarter and cleaner urban commute,” said Bernie Llamzon, President of Gogoro Philippines.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gogoro Battery Swapping</strong></p>
<p>Beyond the Smartscooters, the GEC shines a spotlight on the unique battery-swapping ecosystem that Gogoro pioneered to accelerate the two-wheel transformation to smart electric transportation in cities by offering quick and easy Swap &amp; Go battery swapping. Consumers will get a chance to witness this global innovation in action and even participate in lightning-quick battery swapping at a GoStation.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong></p>
<p>Gogoro Philippines will be announcing pricing and availability for some Smartscooter® models on December 1, 2023 as well as additional models that will be available in early 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>
<p>There will also be a wide variety of accessories available for riders to personalize their Smartscooters® to meet their specific needs, whether to add extra convenience, style, or functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Test Rides</strong></p>
<p>The best way to experience Gogoro Smartscooters® and battery swapping is by taking a test ride. At the GEC, visitors can easily book a test ride and dive deep into Gogoro Smartscooter® features, and feel the thrill of riding the world's most advanced electric two-wheel vehicles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The GEC reflects Gogoro’s commitment to making its cutting-edge technology accessible to Filipinos. A joint venture between Globe’s 917Ventures Inc., Ayala Corporation, and Gogoro of Taiwan, Gogoro Philippines aims to redefine the local transportation landscape, in line with Gogoro's global mission of empowering cities with sustainable and intelligent mobility solutions.</p>
