<p style="text-align: center;"><em>FLO DRIVE Will be Showcased on the Gogoro Viva Mix at EICMA 2021, the Premiere Global Two-Wheeler Expo, in Milan, Italy, November 23-28</em></p>
<p><strong>DENVER and TAIPEI, Nov. 16, 2021</strong> &mdash; Gates (NYSE: GTES), the global leader in clean, quiet and reliable belt drives, and Gogoro, a global technology leader in battery swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable urban mobility, today announced an expanded exclusive partnership to accelerate sustainable urban transportation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The partnership with Gogoro brings together two like-minded, innovative companies focused on accelerating sustainable urban transportation,&rdquo; said Ivo Jurek, CEO, Gates. &ldquo;Gogoro&rsquo;s battery swapping platform and robust vehicle ecosystem are unmatched, and this partnership will allow both of us to continue the rapid expansion of electric micromobility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of the renewed partnership, Gates and Gogoro co-developed FLO DRIVE&trade;, a vehicle drivetrain system based on Gates Carbon Drive that will be exclusively available to Powered By Gogoro Network (PBGN) vehicle makers through the Gogoro Development Kit (GDK). The GDK provides Gogoro's vehicle partners with the most powerful, connected and efficient electric two-wheel power system on the market today. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gogoro and Gates have worked together for years, and our new exclusive partnership strengthens our collaboration and joint commitment to accelerating the urban mobility shift to electric. The durability and low maintenance of the co-developed FLO DRIVE system means these vehicles are more sustainable because they last longer, are more efficient, quieter and easier to own,&rdquo; said Horace Luke, founder and CEO, Gogoro. &ldquo;Our partnership with Gates is focused on innovation, a joint commitment to sustainability and a positive view for how electrification of our cities will create a positive future. This is the decade of electric mobility, and 2022 is the year smart mobility comes to the masses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gates&rsquo;s innovative Carbon Drive system includes a carbon-fiber reinforced belt and highly engineered sprockets to deliver a compact, lightweight drive with low noise, high power efficiency, unmatched durability and minimal maintenance, making it far superior to chain alternatives.</p>
<p>Gogoro has designed a portfolio of innovations in battery swapping, smart batteries, cloud services, compact electric propulsion and vehicles that enable its vehicle partners to develop new electric two-wheel vehicles for the most intelligent urban mobility ecosystem focused using Gogoro battery swapping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FLO DRIVE, featuring the complete Gates Carbon Drive system, will be on display on the Gogoro Viva Mix Smartscooter at EICMA 2021 Hall 15P, Stand G06, the premiere global two-wheeler exposition, in Milan, Italy, November 23-28.</p>
