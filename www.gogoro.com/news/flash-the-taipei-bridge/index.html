<h5><em>Video produced by the Gogoro Owners Club and used with permission.</em>&nbsp;</h5>
<p>For months, Gogoro Owners have been telling us about wanting&nbsp;to ride Taipei Bridge - that is, to organize as many Smartscooter riders as possible to flood&nbsp;one of the most famous expressways for scooter commuters in Taipei.<br /><!--more--><br />While the word "flood" may sound like a commotion, the true intention was to&nbsp;show how different this bridge could be when packed&nbsp;with electric vehicles. Known for being crowded, hot, and humid, typical riders mask up and still suffer from the overwhelming odor of petrol emissions. &nbsp;And if awakening&nbsp;those senses wasn't enough, the gas-powered motors rev and beep, rattling the&nbsp;most fierce&nbsp;eardrums.</p>
<p>On the cool&nbsp;Saturday morning of June 18th at 6:00am, in a event completely organized by the owners themselves, over 300 Smartscooters took to the bridge in an orderly line. &nbsp;These riders inspire us not just for their group effort in coordinating the ride, but for proving that yes, it is possible for a place like&nbsp;Taipei Bridge&nbsp;to be neat, clean, and&nbsp;quiet.</p>
<p>Is this what the future could look like?</p>
