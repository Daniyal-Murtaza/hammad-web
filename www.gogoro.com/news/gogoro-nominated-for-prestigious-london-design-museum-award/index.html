<p>Gogoro&reg;, a technology leader transforming how innovation is bridging sustainable energy and urban transportation, announced today it had been selected as a finalist for the prestigious Beazley Designs of the Year awards. The exhibition will inform part of the opening program in the Design Museum&rsquo;s spectacular new home of Kensington, London.</p>
<p>Comprised of more than 70 nominations, the exhibition celebrates the best global designs of the past year across six categories: Architecture, Digital, Fashion, Graphics, Product and Transport. Selected by a panel of distinguished international designers, curators, and creatives, the awards showcase the most original and exciting products, concepts and designers in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gogoro is honored to be nominated for the prestigious Beazley Designs of the Year Award,&rdquo; said Horace Luke, co-founder, and CEO of Gogoro. &ldquo;Gogoro was created to incite positive change in the world&rsquo;s cities by providing a new paradigm for energy use and a transportation alternative that promotes electric power over gasoline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A winner will be selected in each category and one overall winner will be announced on 26 January 2017. Previous winners have included the 2012 Olympic Torch and the Heydar Aliyev Centre by Zaha Hadid. Last year the accolade was awarded to Human Organs-on-Chips, a microdevice lined with living human cells to mimic the complex tissues structures of the human body. Beazley Designs of the Year will be on display from 24 November 2016 &ndash; 19 February 2017.</p>
