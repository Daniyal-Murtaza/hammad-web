          <p style="text-align: center;">Companies launch Gogoro Smartscooters® and Battery-Swapping pilot in Metro Manila, announce public availability by Q4 2023</p>
<p><strong>MANILA, Philippines, 24 April 2023</strong> – Leading Filipino digital solutions platform Globe Group’s 917Ventures, top Philippine conglomerate Ayala Corporation, and Gogoro Inc., (Nasdaq: GGR), a global technology leader in battery-swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities, today launched Gogoro Smartscooters® and battery-swapping in the Philippines. In ceremonies at Globe’s headquarters, the three companies also announced Gogoro’s public availability in Metro Manila by Q4 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We in the Globe Group are very proud to bring Gogoro Smartscooters® and battery-swapping to the Philippines, a transport ecosystem that marries mobility innovation and sustainability,” said Ernest Cu, Globe Group President and CEO. “This year, Filipinos will have access to these electric two wheel vehicles and Gogoro’s convenient and cost-efficient battery-swapping technology, another first in the Philippines.”</p>
<p>The Gogoro launch marks the climate tech debut of the Globe Group as it continues to deliver innovations that address Filipinos’ daily pain points. Together, the companies are introducing a new era in sustainable transportation that brings together smart, convenient and accessible two-wheel electric vehicles to customers.</p>
<p>It also marks the Philippine entry of Gogoro, a company that has transformed two-wheel mobility in Taiwan and fostered a new smart mobility industry with a network of eco-friendly businesses and end-users. In addition to Taiwan and the Philippines, Gogoro is also operating in China, India, Japan, Indonesia, Korea and Israel.</p>
<p>As a better transportation alternative, Gogoro aims to address commuter woes on expensive gas prices while helping curb carbon emissions that are in line with partners’ shared commitment to sustainability, and the Philippine government's sustainable development agenda.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with the Globe Group and Ayala Corporation in the Philippines is a major milestone in our mission to transform urban transportation and provide an accessible path for riders to adopt sustainable urban mobility and play a key role in battling climate change and making the world better for all,” said Horace Luke, Founder and CEO of Gogoro. “We look forward to working together to deliver a sustainable transport system that will improve air quality, reduce carbon emissions, and provide a superior riding experience for consumers in the Philippines.”</p>
<p>Luke said the company is excited to bring the Gogoro ecosystem to the Philippines and is committed to replicating its success in Taiwan, where Gogoro has 540,000 riders and has deployed more than 1 million smart batteries at 12,000 battery-swapping stations. Gogoro riders have swapped more than 450 million total swaps; 400,000 per day; and, Gogoro has saved more than 627,000 tons of CO2 since launching.</p>
<p>"The Gogoro ecosystem is very convenient as its swap-and-go technology allows riders to swap out depleted batteries for charged ones in just seconds and go on their way. With the current traffic situation in the metro, these Smartscooters® will serve as an eco-friendly alternative to ease congestion while at the same time reducing carbon emissions,” said Bernie Llamzon, Globe Capital Venture Holdings Inc. Director.</p>
<p>Cu thanked the Philippine government’s support for the shift to EVs as he cited the importance of enabling policy for electric vehicles to succeed in the country.</p>
<p>“The shift to EVs, particularly deploying Gogoro’s battery-swapping system, will go a long way with sustained government support that will allow private sector initiatives to prosper. Sustainable transportation projects are, after all, aligned with the government’s long-term agenda to promote environment-friendly transport options and foster digitalization as mobility needs of Filipino individuals and businesses rise,” said Cu.&nbsp;</p>
