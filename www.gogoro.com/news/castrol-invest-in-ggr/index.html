          <p><strong>London and Taipei, June 25, 2024</strong> – Castrol, a global leader in lubricants and part of the bp group, today announced an investment of up to US$50 million in Gogoro Inc. (Nasdaq: GGR), a global technology leader in battery-swapping ecosystems that enable smart mobility solutions for cities.</p>
<p>In the first tranche of the investment, Castrol Holdings, an affiliate of Castrol, will invest US$25 million in ordinary shares of Gogoro. This investment is expected to be followed by a second US$25 million investment in the form of a convertible note, which is subject to the consummation of certain transactions by the parties in connection with their business collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first tranche investment will result in Castrol acquiring approximately 5.72% of Gogoro’s outstanding ordinary shares and it will be Castrol’s first step to unlock diversification opportunities beyond its core lubricants and fluids business under its new <a href="https://www.castrol.com/en_gb/united-kingdom/home/castrol-story/newsroom/press-releases/castrol-turns-125-looks-to-the-future-with-new-strategy.html">‘Onward, Upward, Forward’</a> strategy.</p>
<p>“Two-wheelers are a critical part of our global product portfolio and as our customers transition to electric two-wheelers the Castrol brand has an important role to play in the eco-system,” <strong>said Michelle Jou, CEO Castrol</strong>. “Gogoro is a global leader in two-wheeler battery swapping and our investment in Gogoro is a strategic step towards diversifying our portfolio, remaining relevant in our customers’ lives, embracing new opportunities to future-proof our iconic 125-year-old brand and to create additional value for our shareholders.”</p>
<p>Gogoro’s vision is to accelerate the urban shift to sustainable two-wheel transportation in the world’s most densely populated cities. At the heart of Gogoro’s ecosystem is an open and interoperable battery swapping platform for lightweight two-wheeler and three-wheeler urban vehicles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Gogoro’s proven battery swapping platform and smart electric two-wheeler vehicles have demonstrated how cities can be transformed when given access to smart, sustainable and convenient portable power. This investment by Castrol is a testament to this success and enables us to expand even faster,” <strong>said Horace Luke, Founder and CEO of Gogoro.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
