Gogoro is the world&rsquo;s first company to receive battery certifications from UL, International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the Chinese National Standard (CNS).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gogoro is moving electric transportation, propulsion and storage forward with a variety of industry leading innovations including the Smartscooter, GoStation battery-swapping and the Gogoro battery. Today&rsquo;s UL battery certification is a recognition that the Gogoro battery is the safest and most innovative electric vehicle battery in the world,&rdquo; said Horace Luke, co-founder and CEO of Gogoro. &ldquo;We are honored to be joining the UL Standard Technical Panel so we can contribute further to making all electric vehicles safe for consumers and champion electric transportation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The UL 2271 certification evaluates the electric vehicle battery&rsquo;s on and off-road performance while also evaluating real-world dangers and usage. It tests for extreme situations by shaking, striking, crushing and spinning the battery as well as testing it in water. The UL 2271 requirements are currently more stringent than any other battery standard in the world.
