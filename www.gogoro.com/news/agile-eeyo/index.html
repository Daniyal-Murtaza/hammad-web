<p><strong>NEW YORK CITY &ndash; July 28, 2020</strong> &ndash; <a title="Gogoro&reg;" href="../../index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gogoro&reg;</a>, a technology leader renowned for its mobile energy platform and ecosystem that is accelerating the shift to sustainable urban mobility, today announced the availability of the Eeyo 1s e-bike, its first US product. Unveiled in May, the modern, ultralight Eeyo 1s integrates the innovative EeyoTM Smartwheel and is available for purchase today in the United States exclusively at <a title="eeyo.bike" href="https://eeyo.bike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eeyo.bike</a> with limited quantities shipping August 10th.</p>
<p>Half the weight of typical ebikes, Eeyo 1 is built with Kevlar&reg; reinforced carbon fiber in a distinct open-frame design for lightweight, electric-assisted city riding. At the core of its nimble and responsive design is the new Eeyo Smartwheel, an all-in-one digital drive that fully integrates the motor, battery, torque sensor, and smart connectivity into a compact rear hub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eeyo 1 is an innovative approach to the hyper-local and multi-modal transportation challenges people in cities face every day and we designed it so riders can navigate the busy stop and go traffic in the quickest and most agile way possible,&rdquo; said Kirk James, chief marketing officer, Gogoro. &ldquo;We focused on the essentials that make it an absolute joy to ride. Because the more fun the ride - the more we ride. And that's the whole point."</p>
<p>The Eeyo 1 is available in two models, the Eeyo 1s and Eeyo 1. The Eeyo 1s ($4599) is available in a warm white matte finish and features a full carbon fiber frame, fork, seat post, handlebars, and rims, weighing in at a mere 26.4 lbs. The Eeyo 1 ($3899) is available in two distinct colors, cloud blue or lobster orange, and features the same carbon fiber frame and fork as the 1s, but with an alloy seat post, handlebars, and rims, and weighs 27.5 lbs - still half the weight of typical e-bikes.</p>
<p>The Eeyo 1&rsquo;s forward-leaning sport geometry is extremely nimble for navigating city streets, bike lanes, and bridges. The open-frame design is strong, lightweight and smooth, and is easily carried on a rider&rsquo;s shoulder into an apartment, subway station, or on and off public transportation.</p>
<p><strong>Features<br /></strong>Easy to ride and simple to own, every component has been chosen for durability and to be nearly maintenance-free. Both models of the Class 1 Eeyo ebike feature intelligent power-assist that detects pedal-power and provides increased control, power and speed, two assist modes &ndash; Sport and Eco &ndash; delivering 40-55 miles riding range on a single charge, and a grease-free Gates Carbon Belt Drive in place of a traditional chain for long-lasting, worry-free durability. Eeyo 1 ships with a charger that easily snaps around the Smartwheel hub to charge the bike after riding. For a full feature list and specifications, please visit the Eeyo 1 product <a title="page" href="https://eeyo.bike/gogoro-eeyo-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Eeyo App<br /></strong> Wirelessly integrated with the Eeyo Smartwheel, the Eeyo app optimizes the ride with a simple and intuitive interface. The Eeyo app also utilizes over-the-air software and firmware updates to deliver the latest features and refinements to Eeyo Smartwheel.</p>
<p><strong>Availability<br /></strong>The Eeyo 1s is available for purchase today with shipments beginning August 10th. The Eeyo 1 is expected to ship in mid-September. Eeyo 1 accessories, including an integrated phone mount and a stand charger to display and store the bike while charging, will be sold separately and also available in September.</p>
