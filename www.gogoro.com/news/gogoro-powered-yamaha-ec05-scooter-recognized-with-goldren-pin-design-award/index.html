<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>First Powered By Gogoro Network Scooter Given Two Global Design Awards</strong></em></p>
<p>Gogoro&reg;, a technology leader transforming how innovation is accelerating the shift to sustainable urban mobility, today announced the Yamaha&reg; EC-05 scooter has won the Golden Pin Design Award and the German Design Award. The Yamaha EC-05 was the first scooter in the Powered By Gogoro Network&trade; program that Gogoro established to increase the adoption of sustainable urban transportation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations to Yamaha on receiving the Golden Pin and German Design Awards for their new EC-05 Powered By Gogoro Network scooter,&rdquo; said Pass Liao, head of Gogoro Solutions, Gogoro Inc. &ldquo;The Powered By Gogoro Network program was created to provide vehicle makers like Yamaha Motor with sustainable electric innovations, capabilities and a refueling system that enables them to introduce unique and sustainable vehicles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Powered By Gogoro Network program provides vehicle makers with access to Gogoro&rsquo;s innovations and intellectual property including its intelligent drivetrains and controllers, components and smart systems, so manufacturers like Yamaha Motor can develop and roll-out unique electric vehicles like the award-winning EC-05 that integrate with the Gogoro Network, Gogoro&rsquo;s industry-leading battery swapping platform.</p>
<h4><br />The German Design Award&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The German Design Award honors innovative products and projects, their manufacturers and designers, which are groundbreaking in the German and international design landscape.&nbsp;This is guaranteed by the high-caliber international jury.&nbsp;The German Design Award discovers and presents unique design trends: a competition that advances the design-oriented economy. For more information, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.german-design-award.com/">https://www.german-design-award.com/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Golden Pin Design Award</h4>
<p>Established in 1981, Taiwan&rsquo;s Golden Pin Design Award is the most influential design award in the global Huaren market. The planning and handling of the awards, the prize-giving ceremony, and all other related events are executed by Taiwan Design Center (TDC). In 2015, the Golden Pin Design Award launched three separate award competitions &ndash; the Golden Pin Design Award, the Golden Pin Concept Design Award, and the Young Pin Design Award. While each award targets a different demographic, the purpose of each is to commend outstanding innovation in design.
