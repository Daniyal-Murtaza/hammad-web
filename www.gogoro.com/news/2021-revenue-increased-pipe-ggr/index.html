          <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Gogoro&rsquo;s unaudited 2021 revenue exceeded prior projected 2021 revenue by approximately 10%.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Gogoro increases PIPE to $295M.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Gogoro expects to close its business combination transaction with Poema Global in early April and list on the Nasdaq under the symbol &ldquo;GGR.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>TAIPEI &ndash; March 21, 2022</strong> &ndash; Gogoro&reg; Inc. (&ldquo;Gogoro&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;), a global technology leader in battery swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities, today announced an update to its unaudited 2021 revenue and an increase to its PIPE to $295M. &nbsp;Gogoro is in a strong position to fund its business plan and is committed to closing its SPAC transaction with Poema Global Holdings Corp. ("Poema Global") (Nasdaq: PPGH) in early April. Gogoro is seeing excellent momentum in its business, both in its home market of Taiwan, and its expansion markets in China, Southeast Asia and India. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Unaudited 2021 Revenue</strong></p>
<p>Gogoro finished 2021 ahead of expectations with unaudited 2021 revenue exceeding its prior projected 2021 revenue of $326.9M by approximately 10%. The company is also tracking well against its previous 2022 revenue projection of $500.2M. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Oversubscribed PIPE</strong></p>
<p>Gogoro has also experienced solid demand for its PIPE, significantly exceeding its initial target of $175M with $257M at the time of the SPAC transaction announcement in September 2021. Since then, Gogoro has received an additional $37.5M in commitments, including an additional $10M commitment being added today, taking the total PIPE to $295M. This significant, upsized cash position allows Gogoro to ensure that it can push forward aggressively with its investment and expansion plans. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SPAC Transaction Update</strong></p>
<p>Based on this, Gogoro expects to close its business combination transaction in early April, regardless of redemption levels, and is excited to become a publicly traded company as it continues to execute its market expansion plans alongside its industry-leading partners. Following the completion of the business combination, Gogoro expects to be listed on the Nasdaq under the symbol &ldquo;GGR.&rdquo;</p>
