          <p><strong>TAIPEI, Taiwan, August 10, 2023</strong> – Gogoro Inc. (Nasdaq: GGR), a global technology leader in battery swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities, today released its financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Second Quarter 2023 Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue of $87.2 million, down 3.8% year-over-year and up 0.2% on a constant currency basis</strong></li>
<li><strong>Battery swapping service revenue of $33.3 million, up 9.6% year-over-year and up 14.2% on a constant currency basis</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gross margin of 15.2%, up from 14.0% in the same quarter last year. Non-IFRS gross margin of 16.0%, up 0.5% year-over-year</strong></li>
<li><strong>Net loss of $5.6 million, down from a net loss of $121.1 million in the same quarter last year primarily due to a one-time $178.8 million listing expense for the SPAC merger transaction last year</strong></li>
<li><strong>Adjusted EBITDA of $12.9 million, up from $9.3 million in the same quarter last year </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>“We continue to see strong interest across the region and around the world for sustainable two-wheel transportation and when evaluated by B2B and B2C sectors, Gogoro battery swapping solutions and vehicles are consistently being chosen. We are on track for market availability in India and the Philippines later this year. In India, we announced a strategic agreement, the first of its kind, with India’s State of Maharashtra government to manufacture our Smartscooters, Smart batteries and GoStations in the state as well as to deploy the Gogoro battery swapping system across the state. As part of the agreement, the Maharashtra government is providing financial and other key incentives to ensure the agreement is executed successfully,” said Horace Luke, chairman, founder and CEO of Gogoro. “In the second quarter, we improved gross margin, operating expenses, and adjusted EBITDA. We also continued our growth in battery swapping service revenue and saw a slight increase in our overall revenue on a constant currency basis. Despite these positive results, our scooter sales in Taiwan were slightly below that of the same quarter last year. But we aren’t standing still, we are aggressively investing in our marketing and retail channel expansion in Taiwan and we are continuing to build out our portfolio. We plan to introduce several vehicle models in the coming quarters that will expand our product family, increase sales and grow revenue in both Taiwan and our other markets.”</p>
<p>“We have established a strong foundation for a successful global business and are well-positioned to increase our vehicle sales and recurring battery swapping revenue across our markets. Our focus on cost management has resulted in improved bottom-line performance, and we continued to see healthy increases in our Gogoro battery swapping revenue in the second quarter of 2023. In fact, our performance against our key financial metrics for the first half of 2023 was solid,” said Bruce Aitken, CFO of Gogoro. “We saw a drop in our Taiwan hardware revenue this quarter, but our international expansion continues to demonstrate solid progress which we anticipate will begin turning into revenue in the second half of 2023. We expect to continue our investment in research and development, network infrastructure and international production capacity into 2024 to lay the foundation for our international expansion.”</p>
<p>Despite achieving targeted financial results in the first half, uncertainty in the market translates to a conservative second-half outlook and we expect our scooter sales in the second half of 2023 to track to historical seasonality. Given the potential for ongoing soft ePTW demand in the Taiwan market, we are revising our full-year guidance to a revenue forecast of $340 million to $370 million.</p>
<p><strong>Second Quarter 2023 Financial Overview</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operating Revenues&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For the second quarter, revenue was $87.2 million, down 3.8% year-over-year and up 0.2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis<sup>1</sup>. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with the average rate of the same quarter last year, revenue would have been up by an additional $3.7 million.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales of hardware and other revenues for the quarter were $53.9 million, down 10.6% year-over-year, and down 6.8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis1. For the entire powered two-wheelers (“PTW”) market, sales in Taiwan in the second quarter were up 13.4% year-over-year, returning to roughly pre-pandemic levels, likely due to deferred purchases. Sales of electric PTW vehicles have not mirrored this growth, sales were down 5.1% compared to the same quarter last year. Much of the growth in the PTW market was driven by a few specific internal combustion &nbsp;engine (“ICE”) models that continue to appeal to price-sensitive consumers at the expense of competing ICE and electric vehicles. Gogoro vehicle sales volume decreased by 8.1% compared to the same quarter last year. Taiwan's consumer confidence index was at a ten-year low at the beginning of 2023 which typically translates into conservative purchase decisions when customers are refreshing their vehicles. This makes our second-half financial outlook difficult to predict. We view the second half conservatively and are expecting our performance in the second half of 2023 to track to historical seasonality.</li>
<li>Battery swapping service revenue for the second quarter was $33.3 million, up 9.6% year-over-year, and up 14.2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis<sup>1</sup>. Total subscribers at the end of the second quarter exceeded 552,000, up 14.0% from 484,000 subscribers at the end of the same quarter last year. The year-over-year increase in battery swapping service revenue was primarily due to our larger subscriber base compared to the same quarter last year and the high retention rate of our subscribers. We continue to see the strength of our subscription-based business model to accrue more customers to maximize our battery swapping network efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gross Margin&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For the second quarter, gross margin was 15.2%, up from 14.0% in the same quarter last year and non-IFRS gross margin<sup>1</sup> was 16.0%, up from 15.5% in the same quarter last year. The gross margin and non-IFRS gross margin<sup>1 </sup>increases were driven by the improved cost efficiencies of Gogoro's battery swapping service operations and an increase in average revenue per energy subscriber due to a combination of new subscription programs and longer riding distances post-pandemic. These increases were partially offset by the higher production cost per vehicle as a result of lower volumes and promotional expenditures on scooter sales this year, while some of the adverse impacts were mitigated by our favorable product portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Net Loss&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For the second quarter, net loss was $5.6 million, down $115.5 million from $121.1 million in the same quarter last year. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to a $178.8 million decrease in listing expenses and a $24.4 million decrease in operating expenses, primarily consisting of a $18.5 million decrease in acquisition-related expenses, a $3.2 million decrease in share-based compensation, and our tight control on expenses — savings of $2.3 million in expenses for sales and marketing programs and $1.5 million in general and administrative expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an unfavorable change in the fair value of financial liabilities of $88.5 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Adjusted EBITDA</strong></p>
<p>For the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA<sup>1</sup> was $12.9 million, up from $9.3 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to a $2.3 million decrease in expenses for sales and marketing programs as we implemented more efficient marketing campaigns and a $1.5 million decrease in general and administrative expenses mainly as a result of cost-saving initiatives. The increase was partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in research and development expenses for the development of new products.</p>
<p><strong>Liquidity</strong></p>
<p>We reduced operating cash outflow by $41.0 million compared to the same quarter last year through tightening our business operations and reducing working capital. We borrowed $22.7 million and paid back $14.3 million in bank loans in the second quarter to finance our investing activities. With a $144.0 million cash balance at the end of the second quarter and additional credit facilities, we believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our near-term business growth objectives. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Updated 2023 Guidance</strong></p>
<p>Due to the soft demand in the Taiwan market, and to reflect our current market outlook and the timing of realizing our international projects, we are updating our 2023 revenue guidance to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue of $340.0 million to $370 million.</li>
<li>We estimate that we will generate approximately 95% of 2023 full-year revenue from the Taiwan market.</li>
</ul>

The forward-looking statements in this communication are based on information available to Gogoro as of the date hereof, and Gogoro disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This press release and accompanying tables contain certain non-International Financial Reporting Standards (collectively, &ldquo;IFRS&rdquo;) financial measures as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board including foreign exchange effect on operating revenues, non-IFRS gross profit, non-IFRS gross margin, Non-IFRS Net Loss, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Foreign exchange ("FX") effect on operating revenues.</strong> We compare the dollar amount and the percent change in the operating revenues from the period to the same period last year using constant currency disclosure. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying revenues performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current period operating revenues for entities reporting in currencies other than USD are converted into USD at the average exchange rates from the equivalent periods last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Non-IFRS Gross Profit and Gross Margin.</strong> Gogoro defines non-IFRS gross profit and gross margin as gross profit and gross margin excluding share-based compensation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Share-based Compensation.</strong> Share-based compensation consists of non-cash charges related to the fair value of restricted stock units awarded to employees. We believe that the exclusion of these non-cash charges provides for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. In addition, we believe it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact of share-based compensation on our operating results.</p>
<p><strong>Non-IFRS Net Loss.</strong> Gogoro defines non-IFRS net loss as net loss excluding share-based compensation, the change in fair value of financial liabilities including revaluation of redeemable preferred shares, change in fair value of earnout, earn-in and warrants associated with the merger of Poema, listing expenses and one-time non-recurring costs associated with the merger. These amounts do not reflect the impact of any related tax effects.</p>
<p><strong>EBITDA.</strong> Gogoro defines EBITDA as net loss excluding interest expense, net, provision for income tax, depreciation, and amortization. These amounts do not reflect the impact of any related tax effects.</p>
<p><strong>Adjusted EBITDA.</strong> Gogoro defines Adjusted EBITDA, as EBITDA excluding share-based compensation, the change in fair value of financial liabilities including revaluation of redeemable preferred shares, change in fair value of earnout, earn-in and warrants associated with the merger of Poema, and one-time non-recurring costs associated with the merger. These amounts do not reflect the impact of any related tax effects.</p>
<p><strong>Acquisition-related Expenses.</strong> Gogoro incurs acquisition-related and other expenses which consist of costs incurred after the issuance of a definitive term sheet for a particular transaction and include legal, &nbsp;banker, accounting, printer costs, valuation and other advisory fees. Management excludes these items for the purposes of calculating non-IFRS adjusted EBITDA. Gogoro generally would not have otherwise incurred such expenses in the periods presented as part of its continuing operations. The acquisition-related expenses are not recurring with respect to past transactions, can be inconsistent in amount and frequency from period to period and are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of Gogoro&rsquo;s acquisitions. While these expenses are not recurring with respect to past transactions, Gogoro generally will incur these expenses in connection with any future acquisitions.</p>
<p><strong>Listing Expense.</strong> In connection with the merger with Poema, the excess fair value of shares issued by Gogoro in exchange for the net assets of Poema was recorded as listing expense in operating expense. The listing expense for the merger is not recurring with respect to past transactions, can be inconsistent in amount and frequency from period to period and is significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the merger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These non-IFRS financial measures exclude share-based compensation, interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, change in fair value of financial liabilities including revaluation of redeemable preferred shares, change in fair value of earnout, earn-in and warrants associated with the merger of Poema, listing expense and one-time non-recurring costs associated with the merger. The Company uses these non-IFRS financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that these non-IFRS financial measures are useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends. In addition, these measures are the primary indicators management uses as a basis for its planning and forecasting for future periods.</p>
<p>Non-IFRS financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable IFRS financial measures. Non-IFRS financial measures are subject to limitations and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. A description of these non-IFRS financial measures has been provided above and a reconciliation of the Company&rsquo;s non-IFRS financial measures to their most directly comparable IFRS measures have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.</p>

We are on track for market availability in India and the Philippines later this year. In India, we announced a strategic agreement, the first of its kind, with India’s State of Maharashtra government to manufacture our Smartscooters, Smart batteries and GoStations in the state as well as to deploy the Gogoro battery swapping system across the state. As part of the agreement, the Maharashtra government is providing financial and other key incentives to ensure the agreement is executed successfully,” said Horace Luke, chairman, founder and CEO of Gogoro. “In the second quarter, we improved gross margin, operating expenses, and adjusted EBITDA. We also continued our growth in battery swapping service revenue and saw a slight increase in our overall revenue on a constant currency basis. Despite these positive results, our scooter sales in Taiwan were slightly below that of the same quarter last year. But we aren’t standing still, we are aggressively investing in our marketing and retail channel expansion in Taiwan and we are continuing to build out our portfolio. We plan to introduce several vehicle models in the coming quarters that will expand our product family, increase sales and grow revenue in both Taiwan and our other markets.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have established a strong foundation for a successful global business and are well-positioned to increase our vehicle sales and recurring battery swapping revenue across our markets. Our focus on cost management has resulted in improved bottom-line performance, and we continued to see healthy increases in our Gogoro battery swapping revenue in the second quarter of 2023. In fact, our performance against our key financial metrics for the first half of 2023 was solid,” said Bruce Aitken, CFO of Gogoro. “We saw a drop in our Taiwan hardware revenue this quarter, but our international expansion continues to demonstrate solid progress which we anticipate will begin turning into revenue in the second half of 2023. We expect to continue our investment in research and development, network infrastructure and international production capacity into 2024 to lay the foundation for our international expansion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite achieving targeted financial results in the first half, uncertainty in the market translates to a conservative second-half outlook and we expect our scooter sales in the second half of 2023 to track to historical seasonality. Given the potential for ongoing soft ePTW demand in the Taiwan market, we are revising our full-year guidance to a revenue forecast of $340 million to $370 million.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSecond Quarter 2023 Financial Overview\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOperating Revenues\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the second quarter, revenue was $87.2 million, down 3.8% year-over-year and up 0.2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with the average rate of the same quarter last year, revenue would have been up by an additional $3.7 million.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSales of hardware and other revenues for the quarter were $53.9 million, down 10.6% year-over-year, and down 6.8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis1. For the entire powered two-wheelers (“PTW”) market, sales in Taiwan in the second quarter were up 13.4% year-over-year, returning to roughly pre-pandemic levels, likely due to deferred purchases. Sales of electric PTW vehicles have not mirrored this growth, sales were down 5.1% compared to the same quarter last year. Much of the growth in the PTW market was driven by a few specific internal combustion \u0026nbsp;engine (“ICE”) models that continue to appeal to price-sensitive consumers at the expense of competing ICE and electric vehicles. Gogoro vehicle sales volume decreased by 8.1% compared to the same quarter last year. Taiwan's consumer confidence index was at a ten-year low at the beginning of 2023 which typically translates into conservative purchase decisions when customers are refreshing their vehicles. This makes our second-half financial outlook difficult to predict. We view the second half conservatively and are expecting our performance in the second half of 2023 to track to historical seasonality.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBattery swapping service revenue for the second quarter was $33.3 million, up 9.6% year-over-year, and up 14.2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e. Total subscribers at the end of the second quarter exceeded 552,000, up 14.0% from 484,000 subscribers at the end of the same quarter last year. The year-over-year increase in battery swapping service revenue was primarily due to our larger subscriber base compared to the same quarter last year and the high retention rate of our subscribers. We continue to see the strength of our subscription-based business model to accrue more customers to maximize our battery swapping network efficiency.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGross Margin\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the second quarter, gross margin was 15.2%, up from 14.0% in the same quarter last year and non-IFRS gross margin\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e was 16.0%, up from 15.5% in the same quarter last year. The gross margin and non-IFRS gross margin\u003csup\u003e1 \u003c/sup\u003eincreases were driven by the improved cost efficiencies of Gogoro's battery swapping service operations and an increase in average revenue per energy subscriber due to a combination of new subscription programs and longer riding distances post-pandemic. These increases were partially offset by the higher production cost per vehicle as a result of lower volumes and promotional expenditures on scooter sales this year, while some of the adverse impacts were mitigated by our favorable product portfolio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNet Loss\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the second quarter, net loss was $5.6 million, down $115.5 million from $121.1 million in the same quarter last year. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to a $178.8 million decrease in listing expenses and a $24.4 million decrease in operating expenses, primarily consisting of a $18.5 million decrease in acquisition-related expenses, a $3.2 million decrease in share-based compensation, and our tight control on expenses — savings of $2.3 million in expenses for sales and marketing programs and $1.5 million in general and administrative expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an unfavorable change in the fair value of financial liabilities of $88.5 million.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdjusted EBITDA\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e was $12.9 million, up from $9.3 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to a $2.3 million decrease in expenses for sales and marketing programs as we implemented more efficient marketing campaigns and a $1.5 million decrease in general and administrative expenses mainly as a result of cost-saving initiatives. The increase was partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in research and development expenses for the development of new products.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLiquidity\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reduced operating cash outflow by $41.0 million compared to the same quarter last year through tightening our business operations and reducing working capital. We borrowed $22.7 million and paid back $14.3 million in bank loans in the second quarter to finance our investing activities. With a $144.0 million cash balance at the end of the second quarter and additional credit facilities, we believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our near-term business growth objectives. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUpdated 2023 Guidance\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to the soft demand in the Taiwan market, and to reflect our current market outlook and the timing of realizing our international projects, we are updating our 2023 revenue guidance to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRevenue of $340.0 million to $370 million.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe estimate that we will generate approximately 95% of 2023 full-year revenue from the Taiwan market.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConference Call Information\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGogoro's management team will hold an earnings Webcast on August 10th, 2023, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company's second quarter 2023 results of operations and outlook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvestors may access the webcast, supplemental financial information and investor presentation at Gogoro’s investor relations website (\u003ca href=\"https://investor.gogoro.com\"\u003ehttps://investor.gogoro.com\u003c/a\u003e) under the “Events” section.
