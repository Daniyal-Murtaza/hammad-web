</div><div>
<br><strong>[ 1 ] Gogoro's Smartscooter dominate as annual sales exceeded 145,000 units, with a yearly market share of 16%<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Gogoro Smartscooter sold 145,678 units in 2019, which accounted for 16% of the total scooter market (Gasoline powered scooters included). This is an unprecedented new record, an increase of 105% compared to the previous year and is an amazing achievement as annual sales growth has doubled every year since 2015. Not only has this amazing milestone propelled Taiwan’s scooter industry forward, it is also proof that market transformation can happen quickly with the right technology and business model in place.<br><br><strong>[ 2 ] Powered by Gogoro Network alliance launches brand-new electric scooter models<br></strong><br>
</div><div>In 2019, Powered by Gogoro Network (PBGN) partners launched multiple scooter models in succession to meet the needs of a wide range of consumers. PBGN models such as the YAMAHA EC-05, A-Motor Ai-1 Sport, PGO Ur1 were all well received by the market, demonstrating success as the total number of PBGN scooters was increased to 274,623 units. PBGN will also soon welcome new models from Suzuki Taiwan as overall scooter market continues to remain lively.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>[ 3 ] Gogoro Network™ launched new smart battery and GoStation model<br></strong><br>
</div><div>The Gogoro Network’s smart battery now uses the new 21700 battery cell technology, increasing single battery storage capacity by 27%. The batteries were deployed in August 2019, and has allowed users to travel even further in a single swap. The GoStation® also received an upgraded design, the 3.0 model has its battery load capacity increased by 50% compared to the previous generation, while the overall space and volume of the station has been reduced by a large margin. The GoStation® 3.0 can continue to provide the most stable energy replenishment services independently up to 64 hours in unstable power supply environments </div><div>
<strong><br>[ 4 ] The extremely popular GoShare scooter-sharing services enters Taipei City and Taoyuan City, 400,000 users signed up in just 4 months.<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Gogoro launched the GoShare "end-to-end" scooter-sharing solution, integrating the existing Gogoro Smartscooters, Gogoro Network, AI Engine, cloud operation management system and other system resources through the GoShare App, providing more flexible and efficient daily mobility options.

</div><div>The Gogoro 3 was the most discussed scooter and was the only electric scooter on the list of “the people’s scooter,” surpassing all of its competitors. Even though the Gogoro 3 series is an electric scooter, its power output is comparable to a 125 cc gas-powered scooter and is very safe. Using materials such as scratch-resistant PP along with SBS front / rear disc brakes, this makes the Gogoro 3 the most valuable option amongst other models in the same price and performance range.<br><strong><br>[ 7 ] Gogoro VIVA, the world’s first featherweight Smartscooter, was launched<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Since its introduction at the end of September 2019, the Gogoro VIVA has been well received by smaller-statured and white-collar individuals for its size, nimbleness, simplicity, convenience when parking, and ultra-low price. 30% of the “Gas Scooter Trade-in” consumers purchase the Gogoro VIVA, it has established a new product range in the scooter market and invigorated the market’s overall development.<br><br>
</div><div>

</div><div>In 2019, the Gogoro Network officially introduced the “Flex Plan” riding plan that leverage Big Data to make real-time energy distribution analysis and projection. Using that data, provide dynamic discounts and pricing to balance the overall battery supply and demand, as a result, all users can enjoy a more flexible and sustainable battery swapping experience. Since its launch in October, the Flex Plan has been introducing dynamic discounts regularly at GoStations, and users have developed the habit of changing out their batteries during off-peak periods in order to enjoy payment discounts up to 20% off.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>[ 9 ] 1,500+ GoStations providing battery swapping services all around Taiwan!<br></strong><br>
