<li style="text-align: left;"><em>Gogoro’s Strategic Partnership With Zypp Electric Includes Gogoro Battery Swapping and Smartscooters for Last Mile Deliveries.&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gurgaon, India, 25 April 23 –&nbsp; </strong>Gogoro Inc. (Nasdaq: GGR), a global technology leader in battery swapping ecosystems enabling sustainable mobility solutions for cities, today launched its award winning battery swapping platform and Smartscooters in Delhi NCR. Focused on accelerating the adoption of sustainable last mile deliveries, this launch is part of Gogoro and Zypp Electric’s (India's leading EV-as-a-Service platform) pilot.</p>
<p>Marking entry into the fastest growing EV market in India, Horace Luke, founder and CEO of Gogoro said, “Gogoro is accelerating the urban shift to sustainable electric two-wheel transportation in India and we are committed to fostering an open and diverse ecosystem of businesses and riders that will usher in a new era of accessible smart mobility in India. Gogoro battery swapping provides a safe, proven and convenient electric refuelling solution that enables delivery operators to manage their fleets and deliveries more efficiently and sustainably. We are confident that Gogoro battery swapping will be well-received by Indian delivery riders."</p>
<p>Recently, India's sales of electric vehicles experienced a remarkable 58% growth, crossing the million mark. The majority of these sales were electric two-wheelers, which hold a 62% market share. This unprecedented growth of clean mobility is a testament to the growth potential of this segment. However, to be successful, this growth must be supported with a convenient, safe and scalable way to provide riders with quick access to charged batteries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With more than 450 million battery swaps globally, Gogoro’s 6-second Swap &amp; Go battery swapping have set the standard for urban two-wheel refuelling by eliminating the traditional EV charging challenges of finding places to charge and then waiting to charge. For last-mile deliveries where the vehicles are often on the road all day without time to stop and charge, battery swapping is the perfect solution. The entire process of 6-seconds swap offered by Gogoro is quicker than a typical refuelling stop on an ICE-powered motorcycle or scooter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Imagine the potential of a 6-second swap in growing EV-led last-mile deliveries where Zypp Electric is already doing 1 delivery every second. This partnership with Gogoro, a Global EV Player with its state-of-the-art swapping stations technology will surely boost the number of deliveries per day and earnings for delivery executives and give them the confidence to go the extra mile,” said Akash Gupta, CEO and co-founder of Zypp Electric. “The icing on the cake will be that every delivery will be decarbonized. We are looking at a revolution in the Indian EV industry and this partnership will be a must-watch in this transition. Excited to start this pilot together with Gogoro to get learning in creating the most suited product for the Indian market.”</p>
<p><br><strong>Optimized For Logistics and Last Mile Deliveries</strong></p>
<p>Last mile delivery fleets require a sustainable solution that not only achieves the best alternative to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles but is well suited to the specific segment needs of the delivery industry. The Gogoro platform delivers the most sophisticated two-wheel battery swapping system that enables delivery operators to manage their fleets and deliveries more efficiently and sustainably.</p>
<p>Speaking on Gogoro’s India partnerships, Gogoro General Manager for India, Kaushik Burman, said "India is a critical market for Gogoro and with the launch of our B2B pilot with Zypp, we are confident that we can bring the best-in-class EV technology and infrastructure to the Indian market. Our ongoing partnerships, especially in the last mile mobility space, are a testament to our commitment to the region and we look forward to expanding our business in the country and scaling our operations.”</p>
<p>With its cutting-edge technology and commitment to sustainability, Gogoro is poised to make a significant impact on the Indian market and help accelerate the country's transition to electric mobility.</p>
<p><br><strong>Gogoro Smartscooters</strong></p>
<p>Known for their sleek design, high performance, and innovation, Gogoro Smartscooters are an example of breakthrough urban mobility. This makes Gogoro Smartscooters an ideal choice for delivery riders who want eco-friendly transportation that is both efficient and convenient. Gogoro Smartscooters are truly 'smart' with connectivity and app integration, making them one of the most advanced electric scooters in the market. Additionally, Gogoro Smartscooters offer unparalleled security for the rider and the scooter, making them one-of-the-safest electric two wheelers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gogoro Battery Swapping</strong></p>
<p>With more locations than gas stations in Taiwan’s cities, the Gogoro Network is a new generation of swappable battery refueling that is smart, safe and continually optimizing itself to be dynamic and versatile for riders, businesses and communities. The Gogoro Network supports 540,000 riders and has more than 1.1 million smart batteries in circulation through its network of 12,000 battery swapping stations at over 2,500 locations. With more than 400,000 daily battery swaps and more than 450 million total battery swaps to date, Gogoro Network battery swapping has saved more than 625,000 tons of CO2 since it launched.</p>
