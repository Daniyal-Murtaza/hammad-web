          <p style="text-align: center;"><em>New Yamaha EMF joins the existing <a href="https://bit.ly/3FGmzkY">EC-05</a> that launched in 2019. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>97% of all electric two wheels scooters in Taiwan use Gogoro battery swapping and in December 2021, 28% of two-wheel vehicles sold in Taipei were powered by Gogoro battery swapping. </em></p>
<p><strong>Taipei, Taiwan, January 19, 2022</strong>&nbsp;- Gogoro&reg; Inc., a global technology leader in battery swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities, today announced the Yamaha EMF, Yamaha's <a href="https://bit.ly/3FGmzkY">second vehicle collaboration</a> with Gogoro. Utilizing Gogoro&rsquo;s world-leading battery swapping platform for refueling, the EMF will be available in Taiwan in March.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gogoro is excited to be supporting Yamaha&rsquo;s growing portfolio of Gogoro-powered vehicles and we look forward to their new Taiwan customers using Gogoro&rsquo;s battery swapping,&rdquo; said <strong>Horace Luke, founder and CEO, Gogoro Inc</strong>. &ldquo;Yamaha and Gogoro remain committed to bringing better and more sustainable transportation solutions to market that integrate Yamaha&rsquo;s incredible vehicle design and engineering together with Gogoro&rsquo;s leading battery swapping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In July 2021, Yamaha Motor Group reviewed its Environmental Plan 2050, originally formulated in 2018, to set a new goal of carbon neutrality throughout all of its business activities&mdash;including across the life cycles of its products&mdash;by 2050. One of the goals was to reduce Scope 3 (Use of sold products) CO2 emissions by 90% by 2050 compared to 2010 levels. The new Yamaha EMF is a strategic electric vehicle that will be introduced to the market in order to help achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Utilizing Gogoro&rsquo;s Development Kit (GDK), the Yamaha EMF was designed by Yamaha Motor&rsquo;s local Taiwan subsidiary, Yamaha Motor R&amp;D Taiwan Co., Ltd. and will be produced and marketed by Yamaha Motor Taiwan Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Gogoro has established itself as a global innovation leader in compact electric propulsion, smart battery design, battery swapping, and advanced cloud services that utilize artificial intelligence to manage battery availability and safety. At the heart of Gogoro&rsquo;s ecosystem is the Gogoro Network, a hyper-efficient battery swapping platform that was <a href="https://bit.ly/33PYzip">recognized in 2021 by Guidehouse Insights</a> as the leading battery swapping company for lightweight urban vehicles in the world. With more than 450,000 riders and over 10,000 battery swapping GoStations at over 2,200 convenient locations, Gogoro Network is hosting 330,000 daily battery swaps with more than 250 million total battery swaps to date.</p>
<p>Gogoro Network is a new generation of swappable battery refueling that is smart, scalable, and continually optimizing itself to be dynamic and versatile for people, communities, and businesses. The <a href="https://bit.ly/3tIcVvY">Powered by Gogoro Network Program</a> gives partners like Yamaha access to the GDK, that includes Gogoro&rsquo;s intelligent drivetrains and controllers, components, and smart systems, so they can develop unique electric vehicles that integrate with Gogoro Network battery swapping.</p>
