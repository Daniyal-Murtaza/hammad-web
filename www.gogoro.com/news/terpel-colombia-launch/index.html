          <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Launching today in Bogota with four GoStations, Terpel plans to expand to&nbsp;14 GoStations by the end of the year and then to other Colombian cities.</em></p>
<p><strong>BOGOTA, COLOMBIA, May 31, 2024</strong> - Terpel, a leading Colombian fuel and lubes company, and Gogoro®️ Inc (Nasdaq: GGR), a global technology leader in battery-swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities, today launched Gogoro’s battery swapping in Bogota Colombia through the Terpel Voltex brand. The companies also introduced the Gogoro 2 Plus and Gogoro VIVA MIX Smartscooters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Gogoro and Terpel share a common vision for accelerating the shift to two-wheel sustainable transportation in Colombia and across Latin America. Gogoro Swap &amp; Go battery swapping addresses many of the challenges that traditional plug-in charging presents,” <strong>said Horace Luke, founder and CEO of Gogoro.</strong> “With 590 million battery swaps to date and more than 400,000 battery swaps per day, Gogoro Battery Swapping has demonstrated that it is safe, reliable and the ideal choice for two-wheel urban transportation in cities like Bogota.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“In line with our commitment to supporting Colombia, we continue to expand our portfolio with alternatives that contribute to Colombia's decarbonization goals and encourage the deployment of electromobility solutions. Gogoro battery swapping strengthens and complements our comprehensive portfolio of services by offering users the convenience of swapping batteries in just seconds. We hope that, by facilitating this experience, more people and industries will join this new mobility scheme,” <strong>said Oscar Bravo, president of Terpel</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gogoro battery swapping stations are initially located at four Terpel service stations in Bogota with plans to expand to fourteen total locations by the end of 2024 with additional plans to expand to other cities such as Medellín.</p>
<p>The Gogoro Smartscooters will be marketed by Motored, a leading two-wheel distributor in Colombia with 10 years of experience in the national motorcycle market.</p>
<p><strong>Gogoro Battery Swapping</strong></p>
<p>At the heart of Gogoro’s ecosystem is an open and interoperable battery swapping platform that is recognized by Guidehouse Insights as the leading battery swapping platform for lightweight urban vehicles in the world. Gogoro battery swapping is a new generation of swappable battery refueling that is smart, safe, and continually optimizing itself to be dynamic and versatile for riders, businesses, and communities.</p>
<p>In Taiwan, the Gogoro Network supports more than 600,000 riders and has more than 1.4 million smart batteries in circulation through its network of 12,500 battery swapping stations at over 2,500 locations. Currently Gogoro has over 90% market share in electric two wheelers in Taiwan and the number of GoStations outnumber petrol stations. With more than 400,000 daily battery swaps and more than 570 million total battery swaps to date, Gogoro battery swapping has saved more than 870,750 tons of CO2 since it launched in 2015.</p>
